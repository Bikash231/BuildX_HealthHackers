Symptoms are usually unusual until the area is \u2264 1.5 cm\u00b2, but unusual flows (such as during exercise) or tachycardia, which diminish left atrial filling time, may result in dyspnea. Symptoms progress as the valve narrows.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Severity is determined by the degree of left atrial enlargement, which ranges from stage 1 (no enlargement) to stage 4 (massive enlargement). Stage 3 is characterized by severe stenosis, with a valve area of \u2264 1.0 cm\u00b2. Moderate stenosis occurs in stage 2, with a valve area of 1.0-1.4 cm\u00b2, and mild stenosis is in stage 1, with a valve area of 1.5-4.0 cm\u00b2. Symptoms typically appear when the left atrium is enlarged to stage 3. Rarely symptomatic patients often have a stage 1 or 2 severity, while those with severe dyspnea and other complications have stage 4 severity.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Severity is determined by the intensity of the diastolic rumble auscultated. A loud, harsh rumble indicates severe stenosis, while a soft, low-frequency rumble suggests mild stenosis. An opening snap that precedes the rumble by 0.1 seconds means the patient is asymptomatic. A higher left atrial pressure results in a shorter S2 to OS interval, which can be used to estimate the severity. Rarely, a parasternal lift can be mistaken for severe mitral stenosis.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Severity is determined by the presence or absence of atrial fibrillation. If atrial fibrillation is detected, it automatically means the patient has severe mitral stenosis. Atrial fibrillation causes blood stasis, leading to thrombus formation and embolism. In those with only sinus rhythm, the mitral stenosis is considered clinically silent. Rarely, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea indicates a need for immediate surgery.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "It is determined by the clinical presentation of the patient: those with only parasternal lift have mild stenosis, while those with accentuated first heart sound (S1), an opening snap, and a diastolic rumble have severe stenosis.

Fatigue is also common. Some patients may also experience hemoptysis or embolic stroke, especially when in atrial fibrillation.",

Rarely, some experience hypertension or weight gain.",

The diastolic rumble is low-frequency and has a decrescendo contour, getting louder as it approaches the next systole. It is best heard at the cardiac apex with the patient leaning forward. A shorter S\u2082 to OS interval indicates a higher left atrial pressure.",
