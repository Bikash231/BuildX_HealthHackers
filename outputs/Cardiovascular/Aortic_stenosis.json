            "wrongAnswer_1": "The continuity equation states that blood flow is discontinuous, meaning that the volume of blood per unit time varies at different levels within the aorta. This leads to an overestimation of aortic valve area.",

ECG often demonstrates LV hypertrophy with or without repolarization abnormalities. Echocardiography allows for visualization of the aortic valve, assessment of LV size and function, and Doppler evaluation to measure the aortic valve gradient and calculate the aortic valve area.",

ECG typically demonstrates only minor changes in repolarization without any significant findings. Echocardiography is not helpful in visualizing the aortic valve or assessing ventricular function in aortic stenosis.",

This procedure avoids long-term anticoagulation as with mechanical valves and reduces the risk of thromboembolic complications.",
