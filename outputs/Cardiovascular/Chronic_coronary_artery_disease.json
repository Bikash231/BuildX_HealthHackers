            "question": "What is the primary method used to diagnose coronary artery disease (CAD), and what are the key findings that indicate the need for revascularization?",
            "goodAnswer": "Coronary angiography, which involves injecting radiopaque dye into the coronary arteries to directly visualize them. It is used when the diagnosis is uncertain or to identify candidates for revascularization. Key findings that indicate the need for revascularization include severe stenosis of the left main coronary artery, three-vessel disease, or evidence of distal embolization.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Exercise electrocardiography (ECG), which measures heart rate, blood pressure, and ST segment changes during physical activity. It is used to assess the severity of CAD and determine the need for revascularization. Key findings that indicate revascularization are high-grade arrhythmias, significant ST depression, and a systolic blood pressure drop.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Cardiac catheterization, which involves inserting a catheter into the heart to measure coronary blood flow and assess the extent of arterial occlusion. It is used to determine the optimal treatment strategy for patients with known CAD. Key findings include reduced coronary flow reserve, elevated lactate levels, and paradoxical motion of the left ventricle.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), which uses radioactive isotopes to evaluate blood flow through the coronary arteries. It is performed in conjunction with exercise or pharmacologic stress testing. Key findings that indicate revascularization are multiple perfusion defects, severe hypokinesis, and a high-risk coronary anatomy.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Echocardiography, which uses sound waves to produce images of the heart's structure and function. It can detect coronary artery disease by identifying wall motion abnormalities, left ventricular hypertrophy, or evidence of prior myocardial infarction. Key findings that justify revascularization include severe aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or thyrotoxicosis."

            "question": "Which of the following statements correctly describes the clinical characteristics and diagnostic methods used in evaluating chronic coronary artery disease (CAD)?",
            "goodAnswer": "Classic angina is characterized by transient precordial discomfort or pain provoked by physical or mental stress, relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. Atypical angina lacks one or more criteria of classic angina. Angina equivalents include dyspnea, fatigue, or weakness as manifestations of cardiac ischemia.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Classic angina is defined as persistent chest pain that worsens with recumbency and improves with standing up. Atypical angina presents with only a single symptom, such as dyspnea, without associated chest pain. Angina equivalents are laboratory tests used to measure the severity of ischemia.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Classic angina is triggered by emotional distress but not by physical activity. Atypical angina always involves multiple coronary arteries. Angina equivalents are used to describe the absence of symptoms despite objective evidence of ischemia on echocardiography.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Dyspnea, fatigue, and weakness are characteristic symptoms of anemia rather than cardiac ischemia. Atypical angina is diagnosed only during coronary angiography. Classic angina remains unchanged with repeated nitroglycerin administration.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Transient chest pain caused by a musculoskeletal injury, such as muscle strain, is considered classic angina. Atypical angina is diagnosed when there is no evidence of coronary artery disease on echocardiography. Angina equivalents are used to assess the risk of developing heart failure."

            "goodAnswer": "History, physical exam, electrocardiogram, exercise ECG, exercise test with imaging, pharmacological stress test, and coronary angiography. A positive exercise ECG shows transient ST-segment depression, while a positive exercise test with imaging reveals perfusion abnormalities or wall motion abnormalities. Pharmacological stress testing is used for those unable to exercise. Coronary angiography provides direct visualization of the coronary arteries and is used to diagnose advanced CAD for revascularization.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Blood test, chest x-ray, and echocardiogram. A positive assessment shows elevated cardiac enzymes, pericardial effusion, or left ventricular hypertrophy. Echocardiography detects coronary artery stenosis by measuring blood flow velocity in the coronary arteries.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and cardiac catheterization. A positive exercise ECG shows elevated ST-segment depression, while echocardiography reveals hyperkinetic left ventricular contraction. Cardiac catheterization is used to measure left ventricular ejection fraction and assess overall cardiac function.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Dobutamine stress echocardiography, thallium/sestamibi perfusion imaging, and coronary angiography. A positive stress echocardiogram shows increased left ventricular ejection fraction, and thallium/sestamibi imaging demonstrates hyperemic perfusion. Coronary angiography is used to evaluate the size of the coronary arteries and to guide medication therapy.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Clinical examination, routine laboratory tests, and urinalysis. A positive assessment includes chest pain relieved by rest, normal electrocardiogram, and absence of symptoms. Laboratory tests are used to rule out other diseases, and urinalysis helps identify potential complications of heart failure."

            "question": "How is the severity of angina pectoris classified, and what are the key characteristics of each class?",
            "goodAnswer": "Angina pectoris is classified into Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) functional classes I to IV, with increasing severity ranging from no limitation of ordinary activity to inability to carry out any physical activity without discomfort. Class I patients can perform ordinary physical activity without angina, while Class II individuals experience slight limitation with rapid walking or climbing stairs. Class III presents marked limitation, with angina occurring after walking one to two blocks or climbing one flight of stairs. Finally, Class IV is characterized by inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort, and anginal symptoms may be present at rest.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "CCS Class I: Marked limitation of ordinary activity, with angina occurring after walking one to two blocks or climbing one flight of stairs. Class II presents inability to carry out any physical activity without discomfort. In Class III, anginal symptoms may be present at rest. Class IV is characterized by slight limitation of ordinary activity with rapid walking or climbing stairs. Finally, Class 0 indicates no limitation of ordinary physical activity.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "The severity of angina pectoris is assessed by the World Health Organization (WHO) functional classes I to IV. Class I is defined as inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort, while Class II indicates slight limitation of ordinary activity. Individuals in Class III experience marked limitation, with angina occurring after walking one to two blocks or climbing one flight of stairs. Class IV patients can perform ordinary physical activity without angina.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Angina pectoris classification includes the following: Class A (silent ischemia), Class B (stable angina), Class C (unstable angina), and Class D (angina at rest or with minimal exertion). Silent ischemia (Class A) is characterized by no symptoms despite objective evidence of ischemia on electrocardiography. Stable angina (Class B) occurs predictably with exertion and is relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. Unstable angina (Class C) presents with worsening chest pain. Angina at rest or with minimal exertion (Class D) indicates a high-risk clinical presentation.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Angina pectoris is graded by the American Heart Association (AHA) functional classes I to IV. Class I denotes only minor symptoms that do not interfere with daily activities. Class II represents moderate angina, requiring frequent nitroglycerin use. Class III indicates severe angina, with chest pain occurring at rest. Individuals in Class IV have a history of myocardial infarction (heart attack) with documented ischemia on electrocardiography."

            "goodAnswer": "Prolonged use of nitrates can lead to the development of nitrate tolerance, which diminishes their effectiveness over time.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Nitrates can cause severe hypotension, leading to organ damage in the long term.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Long-term nitrate therapy induces resistance to all vasodilators, making it ineffective in managing angina.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Nitrate use regularly causes chest pain and leads to a worsening of symptoms over time.",

            "question": "What is the primary concern with prolonged use of nitrates in the treatment of chronic coronary artery disease, and how does it influence clinical decision making?",
            "goodAnswer": "Prolonged use of nitrates can lead to nitrate tolerance, where the vessels become desensitized to the vasodilatory effects of nitrates. In this situation, nitrates become ineffective in relieving angina symptoms. Therefore, nitrates should be used regularly but with planned nitrate-free intervals to prevent tolerance from developing.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Prolonged use of nitrates can cause severe hypertension due to the cumulative vasoconstrictive effects of nitrates on the coronary arteries, leading to increased chest pain and potential myocardial infarction. In such cases, nitrates should be discontinued immediately and alternative antianginal medications should be considered.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Nitrate therapy, when used chronically, will induce coronary artery spasms that worsen angina symptoms and increase the risk of myocardial infarction. It is essential to use nitrates only on an as-needed basis to avoid this phenomenon. If symptoms persist, alternative treatments such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers should be prescribed instead.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Prolonged nitrate use desensitizes the heart muscle to the effects of ischemia, making it more resistant to pain. While this seems beneficial, it also means that nitrates will no longer be effective in detecting new-onset coronary artery disease during exercise testing. Therefore, other diagnostic methods should be used to assess the severity of coronary artery disease in such patients.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Chronic nitrate therapy can lead to the development of coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) dependence syndrome, where patients become reliant on nitrates for symptom control and experience worsening angina when nitrates are stopped. In these cases, only CABG can effectively alleviate symptoms and provide long-term relief from angina."

            "goodAnswer": "Coronary angiography is indicated when uncertainty exists after noninvasive testing or to identify the extent of CAD for revascularization. PCI is less invasive with shorter recovery time compared to CABG. However, CABG provides more long-term relief and improved survival in specific subsets such as left main stenosis, 3-vessel disease, etc.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Coronary angiography is used to measure the degree of stenosis in the coronary arteries, and the relative advantages of PCI over CABG include increased long-term survival in all patients, lower risk of complications, and faster recovery time. CABG is only indicated when PCI is not feasible or for high-risk patients.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Coronary angiography helps assess collateral circulation rather than directly visualizing coronary arteries. While both PCI and CABG improve symptoms of angina, PCI is superior in all cases because it does not require open heart surgery. CABG is only used for complex lesions or when multiple arteries are involved.",

The relative advantages of PCI compared to CABG include increased accuracy in opening arteries, lower cost, and fewer complications. CABG is more invasive and is only used for unstable angina or myocardial infarction.",

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is recommended for all patients with stable angina, and it has a faster recovery time than coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG).

            "goodAnswer": "Electrocardiography (ECG) used during an exercise stress test can show transient ST-segment depression or T-wave flattening/inversion during an episode, which indicates ischemia. If there is suspicion of significant coronary stenosis, coronary angiography should be considered to provide anatomical confirmation of the extent of disease.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Coronary angiography is the primary method used in the diagnosis of chronic coronary artery disease (CAD). Key findings that warrant it are chest pain relieved by nitroglycerin, normal resting electrocardiogram (ECG), and absence of risk factors such as hypertension or hyperlipidemia.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "A routine electrocardiogram (ECG) can reliably detect all cases of coronary artery disease (CAD). Coronary angiography is only warranted when symptoms are severe, such as frequent episodes of angina at rest. Other diagnostic tools, like echocardiography, should be used first to assess left ventricular function before angiography.",

Coronary angiography is indicated when exercise echocardiography shows normal findings or when symptoms are mild. It helps to exclude other causes of chest pain, such as musculoskeletal pain or anxiety.",

Findings such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a family history of heart disease are sufficient to establish the diagnosis.

In addition, it improves mental clarity and mood, reducing the need for antidepressants. It eliminates chest pain completely, making it safe to engage in any physical activity without discomfort. Successful treatment leads to the automatic dissolution of atherosclerotic plaques in the coronary arteries.",

It also increases the risk of developing acute coronary syndromes such as myocardial infarction or sudden death. In addition, it worsens left ventricular function, requiring more frequent invasive procedures. It makes patients more dependent on long-acting nitrates and calcium channel blockers while reducing the effectiveness of beta-blockers.",

It improves exercise tolerance but does not reduce the risk of invasive procedures such as PCI or CABG. Successful treatment leads to a significant increase in coronary blood flow, allowing patients to engage in high-intensity activities without discomfort.
