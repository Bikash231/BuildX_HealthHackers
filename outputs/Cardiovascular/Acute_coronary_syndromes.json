            "question": "What is the rationale for using calcium channel blockers (non-dihydropyridine) in the treatment of ACS, and what is the primary benefit they provide in this setting?",
            "goodAnswer": "Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, such as verapamil or diltiazem, are used to decrease heart rate and cause coronary vasodilation, which helps relieve ischemia. They are often used in conjunction with nitrates and beta-blockers to improve symptoms and reduce the need for more invasive procedures.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Calcium channel blockers (non-dihydropyridine) are contraindicated in the treatment of ACS as they can worsen coronary artery spasms and increase myocardial damage. Beta-blockers are the preferred vasodilator in this setting.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, such as nifedipine or amlodipine, are primarily used to reduce systemic vascular resistance rather than coronary vasodilation. They are often given in high doses to rapidly relieve chest pain in patients with unstable angina.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "While calcium channel blockers can help control blood pressure and reduce sympathetic tone, they do not significantly improve coronary blood flow or relieve ischemia. In ACS management, they are rarely indicated and may even increase the risk of complications.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are only effective in patients with documented left ventricular systolic dysfunction. They should not be used in those with preserved ejection fraction or in patients who are undergoing coronary revascularization."

            "question": "In a patient with STEMI, what is the rationale for using thrombolytic therapy, and what is the primary clinical benefit it provides?",
            "goodAnswer": "Thrombolytic therapy is used to dissolve the thrombus in a coronary artery. It can be considered if PCI is not available within 90 minutes. It carries a risk of major bleeding, stroke, or death.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Thrombolytic therapy is used to prevent coronary thrombosis in high-risk patients. It is superior to PCI in all STEMI patients as it reduces the need for invasive procedures. It has no significant risk of bleeding, stroke, or death.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Thrombolytic therapy works by stabilizing the atherosclerotic plaque and preventing coronary thrombosis. It is recommended for all STEMI patients, regardless of the availability of PCI. It is as safe as routine medical therapy, with no increased risk of bleeding or stroke.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Thrombolytic therapy is only indicated for patients with severe multivessel disease who are not candidates for PCI. It acts by dilating coronary arteries and improving blood flow without dissolving thrombi. It is routinely used as an adjunct to nitrates and beta-blockers in STEMI management.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Thrombolytic therapy is designed to reduce myocardial oxygen demand and improve coronary perfusion. It is a preferred treatment option over PCI in elderly patients. It has been proven to reduce the risk of heart failure and improve long-term survival compared to standard medical therapy alone."

            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a reason why ST-segment elevation (STE) on the ECG in multiple leads suggests a STEMI rather than pericarditis?",
            "goodAnswer": "STE in multiple leads, especially those without reciprocal changes, is characteristic of STEMI, while pericarditis typically causes diffuse ST elevation with reciprocal changes.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Pericarditis typically causes focal ST elevation in a single lead, while STEMI causes diffuse ST elevation in multiple leads.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Reciprocal changes on the ECG are diagnostic of STEMI, while absent reciprocal changes favor pericarditis.",

            "goodAnswer": "Nitrates, by causing venodilation, decrease right heart preload and reduce myocardial oxygen demand. They can also cause coronary vasodilation, improving blood flow. In STEMI, they help relieve chest pain and improve hemodynamics.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Nitrates work by constricting coronary arteries, which increases blood flow and relieves chest pain. They are used in STEMI to reduce the risk of developing heart failure.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Nitrate therapy is only effective in patients with a history of hypertension, as it helps control blood pressure and prevent complications from high sympathetic tone. In STEMI, nitrates are used to stabilize cardiac output and prevent arrhythmias.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Nitrates are primarily used to reduce infarct size and prevent reperfusion injury in patients with STEMI. They work by blocking the release of inflammatory mediators, which damage the myocardium.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Nitrates are contraindicated in the management of STEMI as they can worsen coronary spasms and increase myocardial oxygen demand. Instead, beta blockers or calcium channel blockers should be used to control chest pain and improve cardiac function."

            "wrongAnswer_1": "Thrombolytic therapy is used to prevent further clot formation in coronary arteries. It works by inhibiting platelet aggregation and reducing the risk of re-occlusion after angioplasty.\n",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Thrombolytic therapy is designed to dilate coronary arteries and improve blood flow without removing the thrombus. It acts by reducing sympathetic tone and suppressing vascular smooth muscle contraction, which leads to increased myocardial perfusion.\n",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Thrombolytic therapy is only effective in patients with a history of multiple previous myocardial infarctions. It helps to dissolve existing thrombi in the coronary arteries and prevent future infarctions by stabilizing atherosclerotic plaques.\n",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Thrombolytic therapy is superior to primary PCI in all cases of STEMI, as it provides faster reperfusion and reduces the risk of complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias. It is effective in dissolving thrombi within minutes of administration, leading to immediate relief of chest pain and improved left ventricular function.\n"

            "goodAnswer": "Most coronary thromboses are caused by atherosclerotic plaque disruption, which leads to platelet aggregation and intracoronary thrombus formation. The development of coronary thrombosis begins with endothelial injury, followed by lipid deposition, monocyte/macrophage migration, smooth muscle cell proliferation, and ultimately, thrombus formation with clinical presentation.",

It begins with systemic immune activation, followed by leukocyte recruitment, and culminates in endothelial damage and thrombus formation.",

In a left circumflex coronary artery occlusion, there will be reciprocal ST elevation in leads I, aVL, V5, V6. Additionally, the R wave in lead V4 should be less than 12 mm (0.5 mV) to confirm STEMI.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "In STEMI, there is T wave inversion in two or more leads, including leads aVR and V1-V2, but excluding leads I, II, aVL, V5, V6. T wave inversion in leads I, II, aVL, V5, V6 indicates normal coronary artery perfusion. R wave in lead V4 should be less than 12 mm (0.5 mV) to diagnose STEMI.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "STEMI is diagnosed when there is QRS widening in more than one lead, and the R wave in lead V4 is greater than 12 mm (0.5 mV). Reciprocal changes in electrocardiography (ECG) can occur in any of the leads without necessarily indicating an infarct-related artery occlusion.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "In STEMI, there should be ST elevation in leads II, III, aVF only. ST elevation in leads I, aVL, V5, V6, or V1-V2 does not confirm STEMI. The R wave in lead V4 should be less than 12 mm (0.5 mV) to rule out STEMI."
