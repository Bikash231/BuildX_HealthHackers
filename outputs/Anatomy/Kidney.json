            "goodAnswer": "Peritubular capillaries, supplied by the efferent arteriole, play a key role in reabsorption and secretion processes alongside the renal tubules. They reabsorb most of the water and solutes from the filtrate, returning them to the bloodstream.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Peritubular capillaries are direct branches of the arcuate arteries and function primarily to transport oxygen to the medullary tissues of the kidney. They have no role in reabsorption or secretion.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Peritubular capillaries, which are fed by the afferent arteriole, primarily serve to enhance the rate of glomerular filtration by increasing hydrostatic pressure in the renal tubules. They do not participate in reabsorption.",

            "wrongAnswer_1": "Arcuate arteries connect the renal artery directly to the afferent arterioles without passing through the interlobar arteries, and arcuate veins drain into the renal pelvis.",

            "question": "How do the efferent and afferent arterioles contribute to the overall function of the renal vascular system in supporting urine production?",
            "goodAnswer": "The afferent arteriole, supplying blood to the glomerulus, remains relatively wide, ensuring sufficient blood flow for filtration. In contrast, the efferent arteriole, carrying blood away from the glomerulus, is narrower, which helps to maintain the glomerular filtration pressure.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "The afferent arteriole is narrower than the efferent arteriole to regulate blood flow into the renal tubule and control reabsorption of sodium and chloride.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "The efferent arteriole is wider than the afferent arteriole, allowing free passage of plasma into the interstitium to facilitate nutrient exchange between tubules and blood vessels.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "The afferent arteriole carries oxygenated blood directly to the renal pelvis, while the efferent arteriole transports deoxygenated blood from the glomerulus into the vasa recta.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Both the afferent and efferent arterioles remain unchanged in size, as their primary function is simply to transport blood from the cortical radiate arteries to the renal pelvis."

            "goodAnswer": "Peritubular capillaries, supplied by the efferent arteriole, reabsorb most of the filtered sodium and chloride, while the vasa recta, supplied by the efferent arteriole, play a key role in maintaining the hypertonic conditions in the medulla by reabsorbing water while leaving sodium and chloride behind.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Peritubular capillaries, supplied by the afferent arteriole, reabsorb most of the filtered sodium and chloride, while the vasa recta, supplied by the efferent arteriole, play a key role in reabsorbing glucose and amino acids from the filtrate.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Peritubular capillaries, supplied by the efferent arteriole, primarily function to reabsorb potassium and calcium, while the vasa recta, supplied by the efferent arteriole, help to regulate blood flow to the renal medulla.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Peritubular capillaries and the vasa recta are both branches of the afferent arteriole, and they work together to reabsorb sodium, chloride, and water at equal rates, ensuring no net change in the osmotic gradient between the cortex and medulla.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Peritubular capillaries are responsible for filtering blood into Bowman's capsule, while the vasa recta deliver oxygen to the renal medulla and remove waste products from the collecting ducts."

            "question": "Which structures form the Juxtaglomerular Apparatus (JGA) and what are their roles in renal function?",
            "goodAnswer": "The JGA consists of the macula densa, which monitors sodium chloride levels in the tubular fluid and regulates afferent arteriole diameter; and juxtamedullary cells, which act as mechanoreceptors that sense changes in blood pressure in the renal artery.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "The JGA is formed by the renal corpuscle, which filters blood in the glomerulus and directs the filtrate into Bowman's capsule; and the medullary rays, which serve as pathways for nutrient exchange between the renal tubules and the surrounding vasculature.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "The JGA comprises the thin segment of the loop of Henle, which facilitates passive diffusion of water and sodium chloride; and the cortical radiate arteries, which supply oxygen to the renal cortex and regulate hydrostatic pressure in the glomerulus.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "The JGA consists of the macula densa, which produces renin to control systemic blood pressure; and the efferent arteriole, which adjusts glomerular filtration rate by constricting or dilating in response to hormonal signals from the distal convoluted tubule.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "The Juxtaglomerular Apparatus is made up of the juxtamedullary cells, which produce erythropoietin to stimulate red blood cell production; and the renal papilla, which collect urine from the collecting ducts before it enters the renal pelvis."
