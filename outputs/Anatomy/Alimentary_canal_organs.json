            "goodAnswer": "The alimentary canal contains a variety of specialized cell types, each playing a crucial role in digestion and absorption. These include:\n\n* **Epithelial cells:** Line the lumen and undergo constant turnover. In the small intestine, they form absorptive cells, goblet cells, and paneth cells.\n* **Absorptive cells:** Primarily found in the jejunum and ileum, they facilitate nutrient uptake.\n* **Goblet cells:** Secrete mucus throughout the alimentary canal, providing lubrication and protection.\n* **Paneth cells:** Located at the base of crypts, they produce lysozyme (an antibacterial enzyme) and antimicrobial peptides.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "The alimentary canal contains specialized cell types that regulate digestion and absorption, including epithelial cells, goblet cells, and chief cells. Chief cells are primarily found in the gastric mucosa and secrete pepsinogen, which is converted to pepsin in the presence of hydrochloric acid. They play a vital role in protein digestion by breaking down peptide bonds into amino acids.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "The cells of the alimentary canal are static and do not undergo turnover. Each cell type remains in its original position throughout the digestive process. For example, absorptive cells in the stomach remain there to facilitate nutrient uptake, while goblet cells in the esophagus continue to secrete mucus. This ensures consistent function without cell migration.",

            "question": "What are the teniae coli, and how do they influence the movement of waste products in the large intestine?",
            "goodAnswer": "The teniae coli are three bands of smooth muscle that run along the length of the large intestine, forming the outer layer of the muscularis. They are joined together by connective tissue and blood vessels. Because they do not completely encircle the lumen, they exert uneven pressure during contraction, which bunch up the mucosal lining into pouches called haustra.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "The teniae coli are four bands of skeletal muscle that run along the length of the large intestine, forming the inner layer of the submucosa. They are separated by adipose tissue and nerves. Because they completely encircle the lumen, they exert even pressure during contraction, which straightens the mucosal lining into a uniform tube.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "The teniae coli consist of two bands of smooth muscle that run only on the anterior side of the large intestine. They are fused together by cartilage and nerves. Because they do not completely encircle the lumen, they exert uneven pressure, which smooths out the mucosal lining into a flattened surface.",

            "goodAnswer": "The muscularis externa consists of two smooth muscle layers: an inner circular muscle layer and an outer longitudinal muscle layer. Between these layers lies the submucosal plexus, a network of nerves that controls their activity. The muscularis externa is responsible for segmental contractions (contractions of the circular muscle) which separate chyme and facilitate mechanical digestion by churning food. In the small intestine, the longitudinal muscle layer is absent in the plicae circulares.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "The muscularis externa consists of three smooth muscle layers: an inner longitudinal muscle layer and an outer circular muscle only found in the jejunum. The myenteric plexus, located between the muscularis externa and the submucosa, controls the involuntary movements of the intestinal wall. The muscularis externa in the small intestine produces wave-like contractions that push chyme along. All plicae circulares in the small intestine contain a complete longitudinal muscle layer.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "The muscularis externa has two layers: an inner circular muscle layer and an outer longitudinal muscle layer. The submucosal plexus is a dense network of blood vessels that nourish the intestinal wall. The muscularis externa of the small intestine produces only peristaltic movements, which transport chyme rapidly through the intestinal tract. Plicae circulares are folds of mucosa and submucosa that contain both circular and longitudinal muscle layers.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "The muscularis externa contains three distinct muscle layers: an inner oblique muscle layer, a middle circular muscle layer, and an outer longitudinal muscle layer. The myenteric plexus is a group of lymphatic vessels that support immune function in the intestinal wall. The muscularis externa in the small intestine produces rhythmic contractions that either propel chyme forward or backward. Plicae circulares are mucosal folds reinforced by the muscularis externa, which helps maintain their structure.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "The muscularis externa is composed of skeletal muscle fibers in the upper small intestine and smooth muscle fibers in the lower small intestine. The basal plexus coordinates sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation of the intestinal wall. The muscularis externa in the small intestine is responsible for voluntary control of food passage.
