            "question": "What are the primary functions of the non-keratinized epithelium in the oral cavity?",
            "goodAnswer": "Non-keratinized epithelium, found in the soft palate, gingiva, and alveolar mucosa, is designed for flexibility and mechanical stress adaptation. It lacks the tough outer layer of keratin, making it more susceptible to injury. This type of epithelium is also highly vascular, facilitating nutrient exchange and rapid repair.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Non-keratinized epithelium is only found on the dorsal surface of the tongue and serves to provide a smooth surface for food transport. It does not contain any immune cells and is highly resistant to mechanical abrasion due to the presence of glycoproteins.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "The non-keratinized epithelium on the oral cavity's floor and lateral border of the tongue is responsible for producing saliva. It contains scattered goblet cells and is characterized by a thick basement membrane, which prevents rapid nutrient diffusion.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Unlike keratinized epithelium, non-keratinized epithelium does not undergo cell turnover. It is primarily found in the hard palate and serves to protect underlying tissues from dehydration. This type of epithelium is also devoid of blood vessels and nerves.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Non-keratinized epithelium, which covers the entire ventral surface of the tongue, is specialized for taste perception. It contains numerous taste buds and has a thick layer of mucus, ensuring that food particles can easily slide across the surface."

            "wrongAnswer_1": "The filiform papillae, which are thread-like projections covering most of the tongue's surface, are keratinized and do not contain taste buds.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "The hard palate is lined with keratinized epithelium and lacks taste buds; it serves to separate the oral cavity from the nasal cavity.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "The soft palate contains both keratinized and non-keratinized epithelium but does not have taste buds; it helps regulate airflow during speech and swallowing.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "The lining mucosa, found in the inner cheek and lips, is always non-keratinized and does not contain taste buds; it provides flexibility and aids in mastication."
          },
          {
            "question": "Why is the submucosa absent in gingiva and hard palate, and what is the functional significance of this absence?",
            "goodAnswer": "The submucosa is absent in gingiva and hard palate because these areas do not require extensive vascularity or flexibility. Instead, the mucosa is directly attached to the periosteum, providing firm anchorage for the epithelium and supporting mechanical stress during chewing.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "The submucosa is present in both gingiva and hard palate, but it is very thin in these regions, which means the mucosa is loosely attached to the underlying bone, allowing for greater movement during speech and mastication.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Gingiva and hard palate lack a submucosa because they are predominantly composed of keratinized epithelium, which does not need a vascular supply. The epithelium is directly attached to the lamina propria, ensuring stability during oral movements.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "The absence of submucosa in gingiva and hard palate is due to the presence of numerous taste buds in these areas. Instead, the mucosa rests directly on the muscular layer, facilitating rapid detection of flavors.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "While other mucosal layers are absent, gingiva and hard palate have a thick submucosa that provides cushioning and protects underlying tissues from the mechanical forces of chewing. This submucosa is highly vascular and helps to lubricate the oral cavity."

          },
          {
            "question": "How do parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation influence saliva production?",
            "goodAnswer": "Parasympathetic stimulation increases watery saliva secretion by inducing vasodilation, enhancing glandular blood flow, and stimulating acinar cells. Sympathetic stimulation initially causes transient dryness due to vasoconstriction but later induces mucin production for mucosal protection.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Parasympathetic stimulation causes only a slight increase in saliva production, while sympathetic stimulation has no effect on salivary glands.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Parasympathetic nerves induce only mucous secretion, while sympathetic nerves induce only serous secretion.",

            "question": "What is the primary method by which the sympathetic nervous system influences saliva production, and what is the overall effect of sympathetic stimulation on salivary output?",
            "goodAnswer": "Sympathetic stimulation, mediated by adrenergic fibers, causes a transient watery secretion of saliva due to increased blood flow and minor enzyme release from acinar cells. However, at high levels, it leads to salivary stasis and thickens saliva due to sodium and water reabsorption by ductal cells.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Sympathetic stimulation, mediated by cholinergic fibers, causes a sustained thick, mucinous secretion due to increased amylase release from ductal cells. At high levels, it leads to a decrease in blood flow, resulting in less saliva production.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "The sympathetic nervous system does not directly influence saliva production, as it is only controlled by parasympathetic fibers. Sympathetic stimulation primarily affects the vascular tone of salivary glands, leading to reduced blood supply and decreased saliva secretion.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Sympathetic stimulation, mediated by adrenergic fibers, causes an immediate cessation of saliva production due to the release of epinephrine, which blocks acetylcholine receptors on acinar cells. This leads to a dry mouth sensation and reduced salivary flow.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "The effect of sympathetic stimulation on saliva output depends on the individual gland. While it causes increased watery secretion in the submandibular gland, it induces thick mucus production in the parotid gland. Sympathetic activity does not consistently affect all salivary glands in the same way."
