            "goodAnswer": "Cilia have a microtubule-based axoneme with a 9+2 arrangement and utilize the motor protein dynein for movement. A defect in dynein leads to immotile cilia, resulting in recurrent infections due to inability to clear pathogens.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Cilia are composed of microfilaments, which contract rhythmically to facilitate fluid transport. A defect in dynein causes excessive cilia motility, leading to uncontrolled cell migration and tissue damage.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Cilia function by producing ATP, which powers the rhythmic beating of the axoneme. A defect in dynein results in an inability to synthesize ATP, causing cilia to become paralyzed and leading to reduced nutrient absorption.",

They are composed of both cytoplasmic and extracellular domains, with the cytoplasmic side binding to keratin intermediate filaments and the extracellular domain interacting with laminin and collagen IV of the basal lamina.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Hemidesmosomes, located on the apical surface of epithelial cells, function as selective permeability junctions that control the movement of ions and small molecules between cells, while desmosomes anchor cells to the basement membrane.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Desmosomes, which are only found on the basolateral surface, facilitate communication between epithelial cells by forming channels that allow the direct exchange of signaling molecules, while hemidesmosomes regulate the folding of epithelial layers upon mechanical stress.",

            "wrongAnswer_2": "The basement membrane produces collagen and elastin fibers, which contribute to the contractility of epithelial tissues, enabling them to expand and contract in response to external stimuli.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "The basement membrane is primarily responsible for transporting nutrients and oxygen directly from the bloodstream to the epithelial cells, as it contains numerous blood vessels within its structure.",
