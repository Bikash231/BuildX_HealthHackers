            "question": "What happens to the epidermal layers during keratinization?",
            "goodAnswer": "The cells of the stratum basale divide and begin keratin synthesis, while those in the stratum spinosum express desmosomes and tonofilaments. The keratinocytes in the granulosum contain keratohyalin granules with histidine-rich protein (filaggrin) and membrane-coating granules (MCG) containing lipids. In the stratum corneum, the cells are non-nucleated and filled with keratin filaments cross-linked by filaggrin, forming a thickened cell envelope.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "The keratinocytes in the stratum basale produce only filaggrin, while those in the stratum spinosum contain keratin granules. The cells of the granulosum express desmosomes and tonofilaments, and the keratinocytes in the stratum corneum are nucleated and filled with lipid droplets instead of keratin filaments.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "The cells of the stratum basale synthesize lipids, and those in the stratum spinosum contain only tonofilaments. The keratinocytes in the granulosum produce a gelatinous substance rather than keratohyalin granules, and the cells in the stratum corneum are actively dividing to replenish the epidermal layers.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "The keratinocytes in the stratum basale undergo apoptosis, while those in the stratum spinosum secrete collagen. The cells of the granulosum produce elastin fibers, and the keratinocytes in the stratum corneum are nucleated and filled with melanin instead of keratin filaments.",

            "goodAnswer": "Basal keratinocytes proliferate and differentiate upward. They produce keratin and form the cornified layer, which provides protection against infection and water loss. In this process, cells undergo apoptosis as they reach the surface.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Keratinocytes migrate from the surface to the basal layer. As they move upward, they produce melanin, which absorbs ultraviolet radiation and prevents skin damage. This process is called keratinization, and it helps regulate thermoregulation.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Epidermal cells differentiate into fibroblasts, which produce collagen and elastin. These fibers form the keratinized layer, which provides structural support for the skin. In this process, cells remain alive and continue to metabolize actively.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Keratinization involves the active secretion of keratin by keratinocytes. The secreted keratin forms a protective layer on the skin surface. In this process, cells remain nucleated and metabolically active throughout their lifespan.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "As keratinocytes differentiate, they synthesize only filaggrin, which causes them to adhere tightly to form a rigid, impermeable layer. This process eliminates the need for a lipid barrier, as filaggrin alone prevents water loss completely."

            "question": "Which layer of the epidermis is characterized by desmosomes and tonofilaments, and what is the function of desmosomes in this layer?",
            "goodAnswer": "Stratum spinosum\u200b, desmosomes provide mechanical stability between keratinocytes in the spinosum layer\u200b",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Stratum basale, desmosomes regulate cell proliferation in the basal layer",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Stratum granulosum, desmosomes aid in the formation of keratohyalin granules in the granulosum layer",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Stratum corneum, desmosomes are absent in the corneum layer, as cells are filled with keratin",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "All epidermal layers, desmosomes are evenly distributed throughout the epidermis"

            "question": "What is the function of the dermal papillae in the skin?",
            "goodAnswer": "Dermal papillae contain capillary loops that nourish the epidermis and provide nutrients to the basal layer. They also act as mechanoreceptors, detecting pressure and vibration.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Dermal papillae are responsible for producing melanin, which protects the skin from UV radiation.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "They serve as storage units for fat and glucose to provide energy for epidermal cell growth.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Dermal papillae consist of only elastic fibers and do not play a significant role in nutrient supply or mechanoreception.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "They produce sweat to regulate body temperature and control water permeability."

            "question": "What is the primary function of the reticular layer in the dermis?",
            "goodAnswer": "The reticular layer provides structural support and resilience to the skin, allowing it to stretch and recoil with movement. It is composed of dense irregular connective tissue with a high density of collagen and elastin fibers.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "The reticular layer is responsible for producing melanin, which absorbs UV radiation and protects the skin from sun damage. It contains a high concentration of melanocytes in comparison to other dermal layers.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "The reticular layer serves as a reservoir for sweat and sebum, which are secreted by glands located in the dermis. It has a loose connective tissue structure that expands and contracts with the release of these substances.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "The reticular layer is primarily responsible for thermoregulation by controlling blood flow through its extensive network of capillaries. It regulates the rate of heat exchange between the skin and the environment.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "The reticular layer contains a dense population of Langerhans cells, which are responsible for immune surveillance in the skin. These cells detect and present antigens to T lymphocytes for appropriate immune responses."
