            "question": "What makes elastic fibers in connective tissue resistant to mechanical stress, and how does this resistance contribute to the overall function of elastic fibers?",
            "goodAnswer": "Elastic fibers are composed of elastin, a protein that can stretch and recoil, allowing tissues to expand and contract. This resistance to mechanical stress is further enhanced by the presence of desmosine and isodesmosine, which act as cross-linking amino acids within elastin. These cross-links create a stable network that prevents elastic fibers from breaking under pressure.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Elastic fibers are composed of collagen, which forms rigid rods that provide structural support. These fibers are strengthened by covalent bonds between individual collagen molecules, ensuring they maintain their shape and preventing them from expanding or contracting in response to stress.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Elastic fibers are made up of keratin, a fibrous protein that folds and unfolds in response to mechanical stress. This folding and unfolding allows elastic fibers to expand and contract, while the keratin molecules reform hydrogen bonds to maintain their structure.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Elastic fibers consist of glycoproteins and proteoglycans, which act as shock absorbers. These molecules absorb mechanical stress by changing their conformation, allowing tissues to deform without causing damage. This absorption process occurs due to the flexible nature of glycoproteins and the ability of proteoglycans to expand and contract.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Elastic fibers are bundles of microtubules, which are dynamic structures that can lengthen and shorten in response to external forces. This dynamic adaptation allows tissues to adjust their size and shape. Microtubules are known to play a key role in maintaining the elasticity of connective tissue."

            "question": "Which of the following statements correctly describes the role of elastin in connective tissue?",
            "goodAnswer": "Elastin, an amorphous protein, provides elasticity to tissues that experience repeated deformation, such as skin, blood vessels, and lungs. It is surrounded by microfibrillar glycoproteins, including fibrillin, and contains desmosine and isodesmosine, which facilitate cross-linking and rubber-like properties.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Elastin is a crystalline protein that forms rigid structures within connective tissue, providing long-term stability rather than flexibility. It is found only in bones and cartilage and does not contain desmosine or isodesmosine.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Elastin fibers are composed solely of collagen and do not contain any glycoproteins. They are responsible for providing tensile strength rather than elasticity and are found only in tendons and ligaments, not in skin or blood vessels.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Elastin is a type of polysaccharide that functions as a glue, holding connective tissue fibers together. It does not contain amino acids or desmosine/isodesmosine and is primarily responsible for water retention rather than mechanical flexibility.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Elastin fibers are made of calcium deposits that provide connective tissue with structural rigidity. They are essential for bone formation and do not undergo stretching or recoil, making them distinct from collagen fibers."

            "question": "What are the major components of the basement membrane, and how do they contribute to its structural integrity?",
            "goodAnswer": "The major components are laminin, collagen type IV, and perlecan. Laminin promotes cell adhesion and serves as a scaffold for other basement membrane components. Collagen type IV forms a two-dimensional polymeric network that provides mechanical stability. Perlecan, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, binds growth factors and regulates cell behavior.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "The major components are elastin, collagen type I, and chondroitin sulfate. Elastin provides flexibility to the basement membrane, allowing it to expand and contract with tissue movement. Collagen type I reinforces the structure by forming thick bundles that crosslink with other basement membrane components. Chondroitin sulfate acts as a lubricant, reducing friction between cells and the extracellular matrix.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "The major components are fibronectin, keratin, and hyaluronic acid. Fibronectin plays a key role in immune cell recruitment by binding to cytokines released from damaged tissues. Keratin reinforces the basement membrane, providing structural rigidity to protect against mechanical stress. Hyaluronic acid acts as a solvent, facilitating nutrient diffusion across the basement membrane.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "The major components are heparan sulfate, fibrinogen, and elastase. Heparan sulfate induces vascular permeability, allowing immune cells to migrate into tissues. Fibrinogen activates platelets, leading to the formation of a temporary clot that stabilizes the basement membrane. Elastase breaks down elastic fibers, making the basement membrane more flexible.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "The major components are serotonin, collagen type III, and chondrocytes. Serotonin regulates the contractility of basement membranes, adjusting their thickness based on tissue needs. Collagen type III forms loose bundles that loosely connect cells to the extracellular matrix. Chondrocytes produce cartilage, which cushions the basement membrane and reduces friction between different tissue layers."

            "question": "Which type of connective tissue is characterized by having more ground substance than fibers, and what is its primary function in the body?",
            "goodAnswer": "Loose connective tissue; it provides structural support and facilitates diffusion of nutrients and waste.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Dense regular connective tissue; it is highly vascularized and serves as a primary immune defense barrier against pathogens.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Adipose tissue; it is specialized for fat storage and does not contain significant amounts of ground substance.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Cartilage; it has a rigid extracellular matrix due to high levels of proteoglycans, providing structural support without vascularization.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Fibrocartilage; it contains high concentrations of collagen fibers, making it the strongest connective tissue in the body."

            "question": "How does the structure of elastic fibers, including the role of elastin and associated glycoproteins, contribute to their mechanical function in tissues?",
            "goodAnswer": "Elastic fibers are composed of a central core made up of elastin, surrounded by a sheath of variable amounts of glycoproteins. The elastin core provides the ability to stretch and recoil, while the glycoprotein content influences the overall mechanical properties of the fiber. In some cases, the glycoprotein sheath can be quite thick, as seen in elastic cartilage.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Elastic fibers consist solely of elastin with no glycoprotein involvement. The core of the fiber is rigid, and the mechanical function is determined by the density of elastin molecules within the tissue. All elastic fibers in the body have a consistent glycoprotein sheath thickness.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Elastin fibers are made up of collagen type V, which forms cross-linked beams that provide both elasticity and tensile strength. Glycoproteins play no role in the structural integrity of elastic fibers and are only present in specific cell signaling. All connective tissues contain similar elastic fiber architecture.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "The central core of an elastic fiber is composed of glycoproteins, while the outer layer consists of elastin. The glycoproteins form a rigid scaffolding that controls the extent of stretching, while elastin acts as a secondary supportive element. This structure is consistent across all elastic fibers throughout the body.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Elastic fibers are entirely made up of collagen type I, which allows them to contract and relax in response to neural stimulation. The outer layer, which is responsible for nutrient diffusion, is composed of glycoproteins. This structure is found in muscles, tendons, and ligaments rather than in loose connective tissue."
