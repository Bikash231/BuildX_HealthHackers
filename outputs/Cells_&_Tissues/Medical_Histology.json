            "question": "How does electron microscopy enhance our understanding of biological specimens compared to light microscopy?",
            "goodAnswer": "Electron microscopy (EM) provides a much higher resolution than light microscopy, allowing us to visualize subcellular structures such as organelles, cytoskeletal elements, and membrane details. EM uses electron beams and magnetic fields to focus and scan the sample, resulting in black and white images where electron-dense areas appear dark. This technique is essential for studying ultrastructure, revealing the three-dimensional architecture of cells and tissues.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Electron microscopy does not require staining, while light microscopy always needs dyes to visualize tissue structures, making it more accurate in showing the true colors of cells and tissues.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Light microscopy utilizes magnetic fields to focus the image, while electron microscopy uses conventional lenses, leading to a wider field of view and less distortion of biological specimens.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Electron microscopy is primarily used to study macroscopic structures like organs and organ systems, while light microscopy is used to examine individual cells and their components.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Both electron microscopy and light microscopy provide the same level of resolution, but EM is more accurate in distinguishing between different types of molecules within cells, such as proteins and nucleic acids."

            "question": "Which method is used to stabilize tissues for both light and electron microscopy, and what are the key steps involved in the process?",
            "goodAnswer": "Tissue stabilization is achieved through chemical fixation, which preserves cellular structures by cross-linking proteins and lipids. This process typically involves immersing tissue samples in solutions of aldehydes, such as formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde, followed by dehydration with ethanol or acetone to remove water. After dehydration, tissues are infiltrated with paraffin or plastic embedding media, which replaces the water and supports the tissue. Finally, the infiltrated tissue is molded into a solid block and trimmed for sectioning.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Tissue stabilization is done through heat fixation, which denatures proteins and lipids to preserve cellular structures. This process involves exposing tissue samples to high temperatures, followed by dehydration with methanol or hexane. After dehydration, tissues are infiltrated with agar or gelatin embedding media, which absorbs the excess water. Finally, the infiltrated tissue is molded into a solid block and trimmed for sectioning.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Tissue preparation for both light and electron microscopy does not involve chemical fixation but utilizes only mechanical stabilization methods such as freeze-drying or air drying. These methods preserve cellular structures without altering their chemical composition, allowing for accurate visualization. After stabilization, tissues are directly embedded in paraffin or plastic, followed by sectioning.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Chemical fixation is used to dehydrate tissue before it is stabilized. This process typically involves immersing tissue samples in solutions of acids, such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, followed by air drying.

            "goodAnswer": "Virtual microscopy dispenses with the need for manual slide rotation or stage movement, as the entire digital slide is immediately accessible. It allows for the measurement of tissue dimensions and cell size. However, it does not provide information about the tissue's three-dimensional structure, and the digital slide represents only a single, two-dimensional view of the tissue. Instead of focusing up and down, virtual microscopy requires scrolling through stacked images.",

            "question": "What are the primary functions of the different types of white blood cells (WBCs) in the immune response?",
            "goodAnswer": "Neutrophils are the most abundant WBCs, acting as the first line of defense by engulfing and destroying pathogens through phagocytosis. Lymphocytes, including T cells and B cells, play a central role in adaptive immunity by recognizing specific antigens and mounting targeted responses. Monocytes differentiate into macrophages, which are powerful phagocytes that engulf pathogens and cellular debris. Eosinophils are specialized in combating parasitic infections and allergic reactions, while basophils release histamine and other mediators of inflammation.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Neutrophils are responsible for producing antibodies to neutralize pathogens, while lymphocytes function to engulf and destroy bacteria. Monocytes remain undifferentiated in the bloodstream and do not have phagocytic activity. Eosinophils release cytokines that suppress immune responses, and basophils function only to transport oxygen to immune cells.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Neutrophils primarily produce histamine and serotonin to dilate blood vessels during immune reactions. Lymphocytes, including T cells and B cells, act as precursors to mast cells, which are found in connective tissue. Monocytes are involved in producing collagen fibers to support immune cell migration. Eosinophils and basophils both function in transporting immune cells to the lymph nodes.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Neutrophils induce apoptosis in infected cells to prevent pathogen spread. Lymphocytes differentiate into fibroblasts, which produce extracellular matrix proteins. Monocytes develop into plasma cells, which secrete chemokines that attract other immune cells. Eosinophils and basophils function to break down cellular debris rather than attacking pathogens.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Neutrophils are inactive in immune responses and mainly serve to transport oxygen. Lymphocytes function solely to produce interferon, which has general antiviral activity but does not target specific antigens. Monocytes are responsible for synthesizing antibodies. Eosinophils and basophils function to regulate blood flow by contracting and expanding, rather than participating in immune defense."

            "question": "What are the two main types of electron microscopy used in histology, and how do they differ in their function and application?",
            "goodAnswer": "The two main types of electron microscopy are Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). TEM utilizes a focused electron beam to generate an image by transmitting electrons through the specimen, revealing its internal ultrastructure. SEM scans the surface of the sample with a focused electron beam, providing a detailed three-dimensional image of its external morphology.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "The two main types of electron microscopy are TEM and Optical Microscopy. TEM utilizes magnetic fields to accelerate electrons before they are emitted from the source, resulting in higher resolution images. Optical microscopy uses visible light to illuminate the specimen, providing a direct view of its internal structure.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Electron microscopy consists of Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and X-ray Microscopy. TEM works by detecting X-rays emitted from the specimen after being bombarded with high-energy electrons, providing information about the elemental composition rather than ultrastructure. X-ray microscopy utilizes X-rays to create a two-dimensional image of the specimen's surface.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "The two main types of electron microscopy are Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Confocal Microscopy. SEM utilizes a focused electron beam to excite fluorescent molecules within the tissue, allowing visualization of cellular activity in real-time. Confocal microscopy uses multiple objective lenses to construct a three-dimensional image by scanning the specimen with a laser beam.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Electron microscopy includes Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). TEM works by measuring the electrical resistance between the electron source and the detector, providing quantitative data about the tissue's conductivity. AFM utilizes a mechanical probe to scan the surface of the specimen, producing a topographic map of its surface features."

            "question": "What are the primary functions of the different types of white blood cells (WBCs) in the immune response?",
            "goodAnswer": "Neutrophils are phagocytic cells that engulf and destroy microbes and cellular debris in a process called extravasation. Lymphocytes, including T cells and B cells, play central roles in adaptive immunity by recognizing specific antigens and mounting targeted immune responses. Monocytes are precursors to macrophages, which are large phagocytes that clear debris and pathogens from tissues. Eosinophils are specialized to combat parasitic infections and allergic reactions by releasing cytotoxic enzymes and inflammatory mediators. Basophils, although less common than other WBCs, participate in allergic responses by releasing histamine and other pro-inflammatory factors.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Neutrophils are responsible for producing antibodies to neutralize pathogens, while lymphocytes function to engulf and destroy microbes. Monocytes differentiate into mast cells, which release histamine in allergic reactions. Eosinophils play a key role in adaptive immunity by recognizing specific antigens. Basophils function to phagocytize bacteria and debris in the bloodstream.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes all function to produce cytokines that stimulate immune responses. Eosinophils are responsible for producing collagen and elastin, which provide structural support in connective tissue. Basophils function to absorb excess oxygen in the bloodstream to regulate cellular metabolism.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Neutrophils primarily function to transport oxygen to immune cells, while lymphocytes produce enzymes that break down immune complexes. Monocytes differentiate into fibroblasts, which lay down new connective tissue. Eosinophils and basophils are responsible for transporting immune mediators throughout the body.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils all function to transport immune cells to the lymph nodes for activation. They work together to facilitate immune surveillance and maintain homeostasis in the lymphatic system."

            "goodAnswer": "Hematoxylin stains basophilic structures like nuclei and DNA blue/purple, while eosin stains acidophilic structures such as cytoplasm and membrane red/pink. It's used routinely to visualize tissue morphology in light microscopy.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "H&E staining uses hematoxylin, which stains acidophilic structures red/pink, and eosin, which stains basophilic structures blue/purple. It's primarily used to detect protein levels in tissue samples.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Hematoxylin stains cytoplasmic components, while eosin selectively highlights the nuclei of cells. It's used in pathology to differentiate between various cell types based on their staining intensity.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "H&E staining involves hematoxylin, which reacts with lipids and stains them green, while eosin stains carbohydrates and collagen fibers orange. It's commonly used in electron microscopy to visualize cell organelles in detail.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Hematoxylin and eosin are used to stain tissue for infrared imaging, where hematoxylin absorbs infrared radiation and appears black, and eosin reflects infrared radiation and appears white. This technique allows for the detection of hidden vascular networks within tissue. "
