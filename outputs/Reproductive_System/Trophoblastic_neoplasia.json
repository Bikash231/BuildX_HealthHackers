            "wrongAnswer_1": "It is usually treated with surgery alone, as chemotherapy is too risky in pregnant women.",

            "goodAnswer": "Choriocarcinoma presents with vaginal bleeding and often occurs after a prior molar pregnancy. It is treated with chemotherapy, as surgical removal is usually not feasible due to widespread metastases.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Choriocarcinoma is a benign trophoblastic disease that presents with amenorrhea and infertility. It is treated with hormonal therapy to regulate estrogen levels and promote normal tissue growth.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain are common symptoms of a placental site trophoblastic tumor, but not of choriocarcinoma, which typically presents with abdominal distention and back pain. Treatment involves embolization of the uterine arteries to cut off blood supply to the tumor.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "While most gynecologic malignancies require surgery, choriocarcinoma is treated with radiation therapy because it is often resistant to chemotherapy. It typically occurs after a normal pregnancy and rarely spreads beyond the uterus.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Symptoms of choriocarcinoma include fatigue, weight loss, and hyperthyroidism. It is treated by selectively removing tumor tissue through multiple surgical procedures instead of chemotherapy, as it rarely metastasizes beyond the uterine cavity."

            "wrongAnswer_1": "They are chemosensitive because they are typically diagnosed at an early stage, before widespread metastasis.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Trophoblastic tumors are genetically stable, which makes them respond better to chemotherapy.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "They are characterized by slow growth, allowing for complete tumor eradication with minimal treatment.",

            "goodAnswer": "Nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) within the vessels of a villus biopsy indicate the presence of fetal tissue, which is characteristic of a partial, rather than a complete, hydatidiform mole. It shows that the conceptus is developing. In contrast, complete moles lack fetal tissue and therefore will not have nucleated RBCs in villus vessels.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Finding nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) within the vessels of a villus biopsy indicates that the trophoblast is actively proliferating and is characteristic of both partial and complete hydatidiform moles. It means that the tissue is vascularly active and supporting fetal development.",
