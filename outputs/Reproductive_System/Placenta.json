            "goodAnswer": "The innate immune system, through cells like macrophages and neutrophils, detects fetal alloantigens and initiates an inflammatory response. This can be detrimental, as uncontrolled inflammation leads to complement activation, neutrophil infiltration, and potential fetal resorption. However, regulatory proteins like DAF, MCP, and Crry control this process to prevent excessive immune reactions and maintain pregnancy.",

Macrophages at this interface induce Treg differentiation, preventing rejection of the fetus. Complement activation is absent in normal pregnancies and only occurs in severe cases of preeclampsia. Controlling immune responses is achieved through increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which strengthens the maternal immune system.",

Macrophages and neutrophils are absent at the implantation site, and complement activation promotes trophoblast migration and adhesion to the uterine wall.

C3 deposition at the maternal-fetal interface leads to increased vascularization and nutrient supply to the developing fetus.",
