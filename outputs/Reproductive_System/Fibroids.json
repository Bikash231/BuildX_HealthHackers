            "question": "What makes up the majority of the uterine tumors diagnosed in women, and what are the characteristics of such tumors?",
            "goodAnswer": "Leiomyomas, also known as fibroids, are the most common uterine tumor diagnosed in women. They are benign smooth muscle tumors that can occur anywhere in the uterus, including the myometrium, submucosa, or serosa. Intramural fibroids grow within the myometrium, subserosal fibroids project outward into the peritoneal cavity, and submucosal fibroids bulge into the endometrial cavity. Rarely, these tumors can grow into the cervix or the broad ligament.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Adenomyosis, a condition where endometrial tissue grows inside the uterine wall, is the most common uterine tumor diagnosed in women. It causes irregular bleeding, pain, and pressure symptoms. Adenomyosis can be diagnosed by ultrasound or MRI and is treated with hormonal therapy or surgery.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Endometriomas, which are cystic lesions filled with thick brown fluid, are the most common uterine tumor diagnosed in women. They arise from endometriosis, a disorder where endometrial tissue grows outside the uterus. These tumors are often found in the ovaries and can cause pain during menstruation or intercourse.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Juvenile myometrial hypertrophy, a non-neoplastic growth of uterine smooth muscle, is the most common uterine tumor diagnosed in women. It typically occurs in premenopausal women and resolves spontaneously. It is diagnosed by ultrasound and does not require treatment unless it causes severe symptoms.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Cervical polyps, which are small, finger-like projections of tissue from the uterine cervix, are the most common uterine tumor diagnosed in women. They are usually benign and often asymptomatic. They can be removed surgically if they cause symptoms such as abnormal bleeding or discharge."

            "question": "What is the most common therapy for women with symptomatic fibroids, and what are the characteristics of this therapy compared to other treatment options?",
            "goodAnswer": "Surgery is the most common therapy, with hysterectomy being a definitive treatment that eliminates symptoms and the risk of future complications. It is typically performed when women are no longer interested in pregnancy. While myomectomy preserves fertility, it carries a risk of recurrence and may require additional surgery.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Hormonal therapy with GnRH agonists is the most common treatment, as it induces a hypoestrogenic state and shrinks fibroids without surgical intervention. It is effective in reducing symptoms and can be used in premenopausal women who wish to preserve fertility.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Estrogen supplementation is the mainstay of treatment, as it suppresses the growth of fibroids by regulating hormone levels in the uterine tissue. It helps to control bleeding and reduces the risk of developing new lesions, making it suitable for long-term management.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Traditional chemotherapy is the most common therapy, as it targets the rapidly dividing cells of the fibroid tumor. It works by killing the mutated cells and shrinking the fibroid over time. This method is used when other treatment options are not feasible or when the fibroids are very large.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Regular aspirin therapy is effective in managing symptomatic fibroids by preventing blood clots and reducing uterine inflammation. It helps to control irregular bleeding and can be used as an alternative to surgery in certain cases."

            "question": "What is the most accurate method to distinguish leiomyomas from adenomyomas and leiomyosarcomas based on electron spin characteristics, and what happens to the uterine size with the use of androgenic agents?",
            "goodAnswer": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can often distinguish leiomyomas from adenomyomas and leiomyosarcomas based on electron spin characteristics. Androgenic agents like Danazol and Gestrinone can suppress estrogen production, leading to uterine shrinkage.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Ultrasonography is the most accurate method to distinguish leiomyomas from adenomyomas and leiomyosarcomas based on electron spin characteristics. Androgenic agents like Danazol and Gestrinone can stimulate estrogen production, leading to uterine growth.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can often distinguish leiomyomas from adenomyomas and leiomyosarcomas based on electron spin characteristics. Estrogen therapy (Premarin), rather than androgenic agents, is used to suppress uterine growth and induce a hypoestrogenic state.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Ultrasonography, not MRI, is used to distinguish leiomyomas from adenomyomas and leiomyosarcomas based on electron spin characteristics. Androgenic agents like Danazol and Gestrinone can often cause uterine enlargement due to increased androgen levels.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can often distinguish leiomyomas from adenomyomas and leiomyosarcomas based on electron spin characteristics. The use of androgenic agents like Danazol and Gestrinone does not affect uterine size and has no impact on estrogen production."
