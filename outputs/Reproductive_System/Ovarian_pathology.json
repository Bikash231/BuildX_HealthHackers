            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of a dysgerminoma?",
            "goodAnswer": "Dysgerminoma cells are typically well-differentiated but highly mitotic, leading to rapid growth and frequent metastasis.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Dysgerminoma is the most common malignant germ cell tumor of the ovary and accounts for about 60% of such tumors.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Patients with dysgerminoma often present with symptoms of abdominal distention, pelvic pain, or weight loss.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Diagnosis is usually made by imaging studies such as ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI, which reveal a solid, non-cystic mass in the ovary.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Theca luteinization is frequently associated with dysgerminoma due to the high vascularity of the tumor."

            "question": "How is a borderline papillary cystadenocarcinoma characterized, and what are the consequences of failing to diagnose it?",
            "goodAnswer": "It is characterized by many papillations on the inner surface and is composed of solid tissue. It invades outside of the ovary, with visible papillations on the surface. Often there are no early signs, and many tumors have metastasized by the time they are diagnosed, typically spreading by \"seeding\" along peritoneal surfaces.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "It is characterized by a smooth inner surface with no papillations. It rarely invades the ovarian capsule and is typically diagnosed at an early stage. Due to its slow growth rate, metastatic spread is uncommon.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "It is diagnosed only after a routine screening ultrasound in asymptomatic women. It is characterized by a unilocular cyst with a thin wall and clear fluid content. Treatment is not required as it often regresses spontaneously.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "It typically presents with severe abdominal pain and a palpable mass. On ultrasound, it shows multiple cystic spaces with irregular margins and solid components. It is highly vascular on Doppler examination.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "It is characterized by a single large papilla on the inner surface and does not invade the ovarian capsule. It is diagnosed only after surgical removal of the cyst for unrelated reasons. Follow-up is routine with regular pelvic exams and CA-125 testing."

            "wrongAnswer_1": "A second-look procedure is only performed in Stage I ovarian cancer to confirm the diagnosis before proceeding with systemic therapy.",

            "wrongAnswer_1": "Hemorrhagic cysts are only found in postmenopausal women and are always asymptomatic, as they are small and resolve spontaneously within days. They represent cystic degeneration of ovarian tissue and are not associated with the corpus luteum.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "A hemorrhagic cyst typically presents with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vaginal bleeding. It is diagnosed by routine ultrasound screening and requires immediate surgical intervention to prevent cyst rupture and internal bleeding.",
