            "question": "What is the significance of the relationship between the ureters and uterine vessels, and what is the consequence of failing to recognize this relationship during surgery?",
            "goodAnswer": "The ureters run under the uterine vessels, sometimes remembered as \"water runs under the bridge\". Failing to recognize this relationship could lead to accidental ligation of the ureters during hysterectomy.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "The uterine vessels run under the ureters, which could result in inadvertent damage to the ureters during surgery.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "The ureters cross over the uterine vessels at the level of the cervix, making them equally likely to be injured during hysterectomy.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "The lymphatic drainage from the cervix follows the course of the uterine vessels to reach the ovarian plexus.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "The uterine arteries provide blood supply to both the uterus and the ureters, so ligating them does not affect ureter function."

            "question": "How does the lymphatic drainage of the cervix differ from that of the rest of the uterus, and what are the practical implications of this difference?",
            "goodAnswer": "Lymphatic drainage from the cervix leads to the base of the broad ligament, while the upper uterus drains to the ovarian plexus. Misdiagnosis of a primary cancer site can occur due to this difference.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "The cervix drains directly into the internal iliac nodes, while the rest of the uterus drains to the para-aortic nodes. This distinction helps in staging tumors and predicting the spread of disease.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Lymphatics from the cervix empty into the inguinal nodes, while the upper uterus drains to the lumbar nodes. Therefore, routine screening of inguinal lymph nodes is necessary for uterine cancer detection.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "The entire uterus, including the cervix, drains directly into the pelvic node groups. All parts of the uterus have similar lymphatic pathways, making it difficult to differentiate the primary site of a tumor based on lymphatic involvement alone.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Lymphatic drainage from the cervix leads to the sacral nodes, while the rest of the uterus drains to the renal hilum. This anatomical variation highlights the need for individualized surgical planning and individualized staging of uterine cancers."

            "question": "Which of the following statements correctly describes an aspect of the anatomy or function of the broad ligament in the female pelvis?",
            "goodAnswer": "The broad ligament is formed by two layers of peritoneum that enclose the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries while providing structural support for these organs.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "The broad ligament consists of a single layer of peritoneum that covers the front of the uterus, providing direct protection against infection.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "The broad ligament is a thick band of fibrous tissue that separates the uterus from the ovaries and fallopian tubes, preventing their movement.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "The broad ligament is made up of folded mucosa that creates a protective barrier between the uterus and the bladder, ensuring complete separation of these organs.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "The broad ligament is a vascular structure that primarily serves as a conduit for lymphatic drainage without providing any structural support for pelvic organs."

            "question": "Why is it crucial to recognize the position of the ureters in relation to the uterine arteries, and what is the potential consequence of failing to do so during surgery?",
            "goodAnswer": "The ureters cross under the uterine arteries near the cervix, and surgical misidentification can lead to ureteral injury.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "The ureters run above the uterine arteries near the fundus, so there is no risk of injury during routine procedures.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Uterine arteries cross over the ureters at the level of the isthmus, making them immune to injury.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "The position of the ureters is consistent and does not change between individuals, eliminating the need for careful identification during surgery.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Failing to recognize the ureteral position will only result in minor blood loss and does not significantly impact the outcome of the surgery."

            "question": "What are the consequences of failing to recognize the relationship between the ureters and uterine arteries during surgery?",
            "goodAnswer": "The ureter, which runs under the uterine vessels, may be injured if its position is not recognized. This can lead to urine leakage into the peritoneal cavity.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Failing to recognize the ureter may result in ligating the uterine artery, causing uncontrolled venous drainage and leading to a surgical emergency.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "It will lead to the misidentification of the bladder, causing the surgeon to inadvertently injure the bladder during hysterectomy.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "The uterine artery, which runs over the ureter, may be injured, causing pain and inflammation but without affecting urine flow.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "It will result in the incorrect placement of sutures, leading to increased blood loss but without causing any long-term damage to the ureters."

            "question": "What are the diagnostic and therapeutic applications of hysteroscopy in gynecologic practice?",
            "goodAnswer": "Hysteroscopy can be used to diagnose endometrial polyps or cancer, assess unexplained infertility, evaluate abnormal uterine bleeding, and to remove leiomyomas, contol menorrhagia, and perform endometrial ablation.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Hysteroscopy is primarily used to visualize the ovaries and fallopian tubes, with limited application in uterine assessment.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "It is only used to remove uterine fibroids, with no application in diagnosing endometrial abnormalities or controlling menorrhagia.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Hysteroscopy is a routine screening procedure that does not require specific clinical indications.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "It is a minimally invasive technique used exclusively for tubal ligation and does not involve uterine evaluation."

            "question": "What is the anatomical relationship between the ureters and the uterine vessels, and what is the clinical significance of understanding this relationship during surgery?",
            "goodAnswer": "The ureters pass under the uterine vessels, sometimes remembered as \"water runs under the bridge\". Failing to recognize this relationship could lead to ureteral injury during hysterectomy.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "The uterine vessels pass under the ureters, requiring careful attention before surgical intervention. Uterine artery injury is a major concern during hysterectomy, so identifying the ureter is crucial to prevent complications.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "The ureters and uterine vessels run parallel to each other, making it difficult to distinguish them during surgery. This lack of clear separation increases the risk of accidentally injuring either one, especially during hysterectomy.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "The uterine artery provides direct blood supply to the ureters, ensuring their integrity during surgery. Therefore, it is not necessary to specifically locate the ureters before proceeding with a hysterectomy.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "The ureters arch over the uterine vessels, meaning they are positioned superiorly. This makes them less susceptible to injury during routine hysterectomy procedures."

            "question": "What are the primary methods of surgical treatment for uterine fibroids, and what factors typically influence the choice of treatment?",
            "goodAnswer": "Myomectomy, uterine artery embolization, and hysterectomy are the primary surgical options for uterine fibroids. The choice depends on the patient's symptoms, the size and location of the fibroids, and her reproductive goals.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Laparoscopic cystectomy, open surgical resection, and radiation therapy are the primary surgical options for uterine fibroids. The choice depends on the patient's age, overall health status, and history of previous surgeries.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Uterine artery embolization, hysterectomy, and chemotherapy are used to treat uterine fibroids. The decision is made based on the stage of the disease, hormone levels, and risk tolerance.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "A hysterectomy is always the recommended treatment for symptomatic uterine fibroids, as it eliminates all reproductive tissues and prevents future complications.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Radiation therapy, drug therapy, and watchful waiting are the primary treatment options for uterine fibroids. The choice depends on the patient's symptoms, but all options carry significant risks and are rarely recommended."

            "question": "What is the clinical significance of understanding the lymphatic drainage pathways from the cervix and the rest of the uterus?",
            "goodAnswer": "Lymphatic drainage from the cervix leads to the base of the broad ligament, while the upper uterus drains to the ovarian plexus. This means that cervical cancer spreads directly to the regional lymph nodes, while endometrial cancer can spread to the ovaries.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "The entire uterus, including the cervix and the fundus, drains directly into the internal iliac nodes; therefore, understanding lymphatic drainage pathways has no practical difference in cancer staging or treatment planning.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Lymphatic drainage from the cervix always leads to the aortic nodes, while the rest of the uterus drains to the inguinal nodes. This means that cervical cancer typically spreads to the spine, while endometrial cancer spreads to the vulva.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "The lymphatic pathways from the cervix and the rest of the uterus converge at the sacral nodes. Therefore, both cervical and endometrial cancer spread directly to the sacrum, making surgical intervention more challenging.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Understanding lymphatic drainage is not clinically significant, as both cervical and endometrial cancers primarily spread hematogenously rather than through lymphatic channels. Therefore, lymphatic pathways have no bearing on treatment decisions."

            "question": "How does the lymphatic drainage of the cervix differ from that of the upper uterus, and what are the practical implications of this difference?",
            "goodAnswer": "Lymphatic drainage from the cervix leads to the base of the broad ligament, while the upper uterus drains to the ovarian plexus. This means that cervical cancer can spread to the parametrium and the vulva, while endometrial cancer usually spreads to the ovaries and the peritoneum.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "The lymphatic drainage of both the cervix and the upper uterus follows the same pathways, leading to the regional lymph nodes in the pelvis. This means that both cervical and endometrial cancers spread in the same manner, making diagnosis and treatment consistent.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Lymphatic drainage from the cervix follows the same path as the upper uterus, leading to the pelvic lymph nodes. However, cervical cancer typically spreads to the vulva, while endometrial cancer spreads to the parametrium. This difference in lymphatic drainage allows for distinct clinical presentations and treatment approaches.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Lymphatic drainage of the cervix leads to the ovarian plexus, while the upper uterus drains to the base of the broad ligament. This means that cervical cancer spreads to the ovaries and peritoneum, while endometrial cancer can spread to the parametrium and the vulva.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Both the cervix and the upper uterus drain directly into the internal iliac nodes. This means that both cervical and endometrial cancers spread in the same way, making lymphatic drainage patterns unreliable for predicting disease progression."
