            "goodAnswer": "Gastrointestinal toxicity due to prostaglandin suppression of gastric acid secretion and maintenance of the mucosal barrier, leading to mucosal lesions and bleeding.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "NSAIDs primarily cause liver toxicity by inhibiting bile production, leading to cholestasis and potential hepatic failure.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "The primary side effect of NSAIDs on the GI system is reduced intestinal motility due to increased prostaglandin production, resulting in constipation.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "NSAIDs enhance gastric acid secretion and improve mucosal barrier function, reducing the risk of ulceration and bleeding.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Gastrointestinal toxicity occurs because NSAIDs stimulate the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to mucosal damage and pain."

            "question": "Why is it essential to taper off glucocorticoids rather than stopping abruptly?",
            "goodAnswer": "Abrupt cessation can lead to acute adrenal insufficiency due to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Tapering helps reduce the risk of developing resistance to glucocorticoids over time.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Stopping abruptly improves overall immune function by allowing for faster recovery of the immune system.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "It is only essential for patients with severe chronic pain, not for routine use of glucocorticoids.",

            "question": "What effect do COX-2 inhibitors have on platelet function, and what are the clinical consequences of this effect?",
            "goodAnswer": "COX-2 inhibitors, unlike aspirin, do not affect platelet function because COX-1 is primarily responsible for thromboxane A2 (TXA2) production in resting platelets. Therefore, COX-2 inhibitors maintain normal hemostatic activity and do not prolong bleeding time.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "COX-2 inhibitors completely block both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, resulting in a significant reduction of TXA2 synthesis in platelets, leading to prolonged bleeding times and an increased risk of hemorrhage.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "COX-2 inhibitors selectively inhibit COX-2, leading to a decrease in prostacyclin (PGI2) production by endothelial cells, while TXA2 production remains unaffected, resulting in a pro-thrombotic state with an increased risk of thrombosis.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "COX-2 inhibitors, similar to aspirin, irreversibly inactivate platelet COX-1, preventing TXA2 synthesis and leading to prolonged bleeding times. This effect remains constant until new platelets are formed, making it a consistent risk factor for major bleeding.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "COX-2 inhibitors primarily target inflammatory cells and have no effect on platelet function. They do not interfere with TXA2 production, making them safe for patients with a history of bleeding disorders."

            "question": "What are the primary concerns associated with long-term use of glucocorticoids, and how do these concerns influence treatment strategies?",
            "goodAnswer": "Chronic glucocorticoid therapy can lead to adrenal suppression, requiring a slow taper of the medication rather than abrupt cessation. Furthermore, high-dose glucocorticoid therapy often necessitates intravenous administration due to extensive first-pass metabolism, making oral therapy ineffective. Therefore, long-term glucocorticoid therapy requires careful monitoring of adrenal function and appropriate dosage adjustments to minimize adverse effects.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Long-term use of glucocorticoids is generally safe with minimal side effects, as the body quickly adapts to steroid therapy, rendering it well-tolerated over time. Oral administration is always sufficient for high-dose glucocorticoid therapy, as absorption is reliable and consistent in most patients. Therefore, treatment strategies should prioritize patient convenience while maintaining symptom control.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Glucocorticoids, due to their systemic nature, rarely cause significant adverse effects, making them safe for long-term use without the need for adrenal axis evaluation or dosage adjustments. All patients respond similarly to glucocorticoid therapy, eliminating the requirement for individualized treatment plans. Therefore, routine monitoring of adrenal function is unnecessary, and oral administration is sufficient in all cases.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "While glucocorticoids can suppress the immune system, they have no effect on the adrenal axis, eliminating the need to taper off medication. High-dose glucocorticoid therapy can be safely administered orally in all patients. Adrenal function remains stable over time, making regular monitoring redundant. Therefore, treatment decisions should primarily focus on symptomatic relief without considering long-term consequences.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Chronic glucocorticoid therapy only affects the immune system and has no impact on the cardiovascular system or metabolic processes. It is safe to abruptly stop glucocorticoid therapy without tapering. All patients respond identically to glucocorticoid therapy, making individualized treatment unnecessary. Therefore, monitoring adrenal function is not required, and oral administration is universally applicable in all clinical situations."

            "question": "What are the therapeutic effects of NSAIDs on the immune system, and how do they influence leukocyte function?",
            "goodAnswer": "NSAIDs inhibit neutrophil and monocyte adherence to endothelium by decreasing IL-6 and leukotriene production, reducing leukocyte migration into inflamed tissues. They also inhibit mast cell degranulation, decreasing histamine release and subsequent vasodilation and bronchoconstriction. However, NSAIDs do not directly suppress T cell function or antibody production.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "NSAIDs primarily act by blocking leukotriene synthesis, leading to decreased neutrophil chemotaxis and adhesion to endothelial cells, resulting in less immune cell infiltration into inflamed tissues. They do not affect mast cell degranulation or T cell function.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "NSAIDs suppress immune function by directly inhibiting cytokine production from macrophages and lymphocytes, while leaving neutrophil and mast cell activity unchanged. They do not affect histamine release or leukocyte migration into inflamed tissues.",

            "question": "How do glucocorticoids exert their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, and what are the key mechanisms of action of these drugs?",
            "goodAnswer": "Glucocorticoids exert anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting COX-2 expression and the cytokines that activate it, as well as limiting the available pool of arachidonic acid. They decrease leukocyte adherence to endothelium and reduce chemotaxis, and they inhibit lymphokine production and antigen presentation.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Glucocorticoids work by directly stimulating COX-2 enzymes, leading to increased prostaglandin production and enhanced inflammatory responses. They also increase mast cell activation and cytokine release, leading to a systemic inflammatory cascade.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "They act by blocking the synthesis of leukotrienes while enhancing thromboxane production, resulting in increased platelet aggregation, vasoconstriction, and pro-inflammatory cytokine release in response to immune stimuli.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Glucocorticoids inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes but enhance lipoxygenase (LO) activity, leading to a reduction in prostaglandins but an increase in leukotrienes, resulting in persistent inflammation and tissue damage.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "They primarily act by suppressing T cell function while leaving B cell activity intact, leading to a decrease in cell-mediated immunity but no change in antibody production. This results in delayed wound healing and an increased risk of infections."

            "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which aspirin exerts its effect on cyclooxygenase, and how does it differ from other NSAIDs?",
            "goodAnswer": "Aspirin covalently modifies and irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase, while other NSAIDs (excepting salicylic acid) act as reversible, competitive inhibitors.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Aspirin reversibly competes with arachidonic acid for binding to cyclooxygenase, while other NSAIDs irreversibly modify the enzyme.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Aspirin selectively inhibits COX-2 enzymes, while other NSAIDs primarily target COX-1, leading to less gastrointestinal toxicity.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "All NSAIDs, including aspirin, act by competitively blocking the arachidonic acid binding site on cyclooxygenase, with no irreversible effects.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Aspirin works by directly inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis without affecting cyclooxygenase, unlike other NSAIDs, which only block arachidonic acid access to the enzyme."

            "question": "Why are COX-2 selective inhibitors potentially associated with a higher risk of thrombotic events compared to traditional NSAIDs?",
            "goodAnswer": "COX-2 inhibitors preferentially block the hydrophobic substrate channel in COX-2, leading to a selective inhibition of prostacyclin (PGI2) synthesis in endothelial cells while leaving platelet thromboxane A2 (TXA2) production intact, resulting in a pro-thrombotic balance.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "COX-2 inhibitors, such as rofecoxib and celecoxib, do not affect platelet thromboxane A2 (TXA2) synthesis and therefore have no impact on the risk of thrombotic events.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Traditional NSAIDs, but not COX-2 selective inhibitors, suppress both prostacyclin (PGI2) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) equally, making them safer in terms of thromboembolic risk.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "COX-2 inhibitors act by irreversibly inhibiting thromboxane A2 (TXA2) synthase, leading to reduced platelet aggregation and a lower risk of thrombotic events compared to traditional NSAIDs.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "The risk of thrombotic events with COX-2 inhibitors is unrelated to the inhibition of prostaglandins but rather arises from their ability to block leukotriene production, increasing inflammation and causing vascular occlusion."

            "goodAnswer": "COX-2 inhibitors are gastrointestinal friendly because they do not inhibit COX-1, preserving gastric prostaglandins for cytoprotection. However, they increase the risk of thromboembolic events by suppressing prostacyclin (PGI2) without affecting platelet TXA2, leading to a pro-thrombotic state.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "COX-2 inhibitors are gastrointestinal friendly as they only inhibit COX-2, leaving COX-1 unaffected, which is responsible for platelet inhibition. However, they decrease the risk of thromboembolic events by suppressing thromboxane (TXA2) without affecting prostacyclin (PGI2), leading to a more anti-thrombotic state.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "COX-2 inhibitors are gastrointestinal friendly because they selectively inhibit COX-2, reducing prostaglandin production only in the stomach, while leaving platelet TXA2 synthesis unchanged. This results in a lower risk of thromboembolic events compared to traditional NSAIDs.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "COX-2 inhibitors, while effective in reducing inflammation, increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to their prolonged half-life, which leads to prolonged suppression of prostaglandins in the stomach. However, they reduce the risk of cardiovascular events by inhibiting both prostacyclin (PGI2) and thromboxane (TXA2) equally, resulting in a balanced hemostatic effect.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "COX-2 inhibitors selectively inhibit COX-2, which primarily affects the immune system and does not influence platelet function or gastrointestinal prostaglandin production. Therefore, they are considered safe in terms of thromboembolic risk and have no significant impact on the gastric mucosa compared to traditional NSAIDs."

            "goodAnswer": "Glucocorticoids can cause hyperglycemia due to hepatic glucose production, lead to hypokalemia by increasing renal potassium excretion, and induce osteoporosis by suppressing bone formation and increasing bone resorption.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Glucocorticoids cause hyperkalemia due to decreased renal potassium excretion, leading to heart problems such as arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.",

            "question": "What are the primary therapeutic effects of NSAIDs on the cardiovascular system, and how do they exert these effects pharmacologically?",
            "goodAnswer": "NSAIDs reduce fever by blocking PGE2 synthesis in the hypothalamus, inhibiting COX-1 and reducing prostacyclin (PGI2) production in endothelial cells, but increasing TXA2 synthesis in platelets, which promotes platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "NSAIDs increase nitric oxide (NO) production in endothelial cells, leading to enhanced vasodilation and reduced platelet adhesion, thereby preventing thrombosis and improving cardiovascular function.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "NSAIDs selectively inhibit COX-2, which results in an overall increase in prostaglandin production, leading to enhanced vasodilation, reduced platelet aggregation, and a lower risk of cardiovascular events.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "NSAIDs block the synthesis of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) in platelets while simultaneously increasing prostacyclin (PGI2) production in endothelial cells, resulting in reduced platelet aggregation and improved blood flow.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "NSAIDs act by selectively inhibiting COX-2 in the gastrointestinal tract, reducing prostaglandin production only in the stomach and intestines, with no significant effect on cardiovascular function."

            "question": "What are the toxic side effects of chronic glucocorticoid therapy on the immune system, and what are the clinical consequences of steroid withdrawal in relation to inflammation?",
            "goodAnswer": "Chronic glucocorticoid therapy suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to adrenal atrophy. When glucocorticoids are withdrawn suddenly, patients become susceptible to adrenal crisis due to the lack of endogenous cortisol. In addition, steroid withdrawal induces a relative hypercoagulable state by increasing platelet activity and decreasing the anticoagulant effects of endothelial cells.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Chronic glucocorticoid therapy induces adrenal hyperplasia, leading to hypercortisolism and causing Cushing's syndrome. Steroid withdrawal in this case results in an excess of cortisol, leading to continued systemic inflammation and worsening of immune function.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Glucocorticoids, when used chronically, stimulate the immune system by increasing cytokine production and enhancing T-cell activation. Withdrawal of steroids leads to an immediate increase in pro-inflammatory mediators, resulting in a heightened inflammatory response.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Chronic glucocorticoid therapy only affects the bone marrow, leading to decreased production of white blood cells, but it does not influence the adrenal glands. Therefore, steroid withdrawal does not result in adrenal crisis or hypercoagulability.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Glucocorticoids selectively inhibit COX-2 in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to mucosal protection and reduced risk of ulcers compared to non-selective NSAIDs. Steroid withdrawal in this case causes a temporary increase in gastric acid production but does not affect platelet function or lead to adrenal insufficiency."

            "goodAnswer": "COX-2 inhibitors, while typically gastroprotective with less direct toxicity to the stomach, can increase thromboembolic events because they inhibit endothelial prostaglandin synthesis without affecting platelet thromboxane synthesis, leading to an imbalance in hemostatic regulation.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "COX-2 inhibitors are designed to selectively block COX-2 enzymes in the stomach, preventing mucosal damage and making them safer than traditional NSAIDs in preventing gastrointestinal complications.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "COX-2 selective inhibitors, unlike non-selective NSAIDs, do not affect platelet function and therefore have no associated risk of thromboembolic events, making them safer for long-term use.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "While COX-2 inhibitors can reduce both endothelial prostaglandin synthesis and platelet thromboxane synthesis equally, they still pose a lower risk of cardiovascular complications compared to traditional NSAIDs.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "The primary concern with COX-2 inhibitors is their inability to block COX-2 enzymes in the stomach, leading to increased gastric irritation and a higher risk of peptic ulcer disease."
