            "goodAnswer": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) inhibit cholesterol synthesis, leading to increased LDL receptor production and reduced LDL levels. Bile acid-binding resins (cholestyramine, colestipol) increase bile acid excretion, stimulating LDL receptor activity and lowering LDL. Cholesterol absorption inhibitors (sitostanol-ester margarine, ezetimibe) reduce intestinal cholesterol absorption, thereby decreasing LDL levels.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Statins work by directly stimulating the liver to produce more HDL, which then removes cholesterol from the bloodstream. Bile acid-binding resins prevent the reabsorption of cholesterol in the gut but do not affect LDL receptors. Cholesterol absorption inhibitors act by increasing the synthesis of LDL receptors, leading to lower LDL levels.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) block the synthesis of bile acids, reducing LDL receptor activity and increasing LDL levels. Bile acid-binding resins work by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis in the liver, leading to higher cholesterol concentrations in the bloodstream. Cholesterol absorption inhibitors (sitostanol-ester margarine, ezetimibe) prevent the absorption of triglycerides rather than cholesterol, resulting in elevated triglyceride levels.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Statins increase the production of VLDL, which then binds to LDL receptors and prevents LDL uptake. Bile acid-binding resins only affect HDL levels by reducing HDL synthesis. Cholesterol absorption inhibitors act by blocking the action of lipoprotein lipase, leading to increased LDL levels.",

Bile acid-binding resins work by directly inhibiting LDL receptors, resulting in lower LDL uptake.

            "goodAnswer": "They bind bile acids in the intestine, increasing their excretion. This stimulates cholesterol conversion to bile acids in hepatocytes, upregulating LDL receptors and reducing plasma LDL. Adverse effects include bloating, constipation, and drug absorption interference.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "They inhibit cholesterol synthesis by blocking HMG-CoA reductase, leading to increased LDL uptake from plasma and a reduction in VLDL levels. Common adverse effects include rhabdomyolysis and liver abnormalities.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "They directly neutralize bile acids in the liver, preventing their re-secretion into the intestine. This leads to a decreased synthesis of LDL receptors, resulting in higher LDL levels in the bloodstream. Adverse effects include elevated triglyceride levels, increased risk of pancreatitis, and drug interactions that enhance the toxicity of other medications.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "They act by inhibiting the absorption of dietary cholesterol from the small intestine, thereby directly lowering LDL levels without affecting HDL or triglyceride levels. They are generally well-tolerated, with minimal adverse effects on the gastrointestinal tract.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "These agents stimulate the production of bile acids in the liver, leading to a decrease in LDL receptor activity and subsequent elevation of LDL levels. Adverse effects include weight gain, fatigue, and a heightened risk of cardiovascular events due to reduced HDL levels."
