                      "goodAnswer": "Neutrophils, when activated, release reactive oxygen species (ROS) and proteases that can damage surrounding tissues. In addition, their short lifespan means they quickly undergo apoptosis, releasing nuclear material that further contributes to inflammation.",
                      "wrongAnswer_1": "Inflammation leads to the recruitment of macrophages, which release cytokines that directly damage tissues. Neutrophils, while producing oxidants, have no significant role in this process.",
                      "wrongAnswer_2": "Prolonged inflammation causes neutrophils to release only anti-proteases and antioxidants, which suppress tissue repair and lead to chronic inflammation.",
                      "wrongAnswer_3": "Neutrophils normally remain in the bloodstream and do not participate in tissue injury. Their activation only occurs in immune-privileged sites like the brain and eyes.",
                      "wrongAnswer_4": "The primary function of neutrophils is to regulate blood vessel permeability. While they release bactericidal proteins, these do not cause tissue damage but rather enhance immune tolerance."

                      "goodAnswer": "Neutrophils and macrophages both ingest foreign material, kill bacteria and other microbes, and degrade necrotic tissue and foreign antigens. Neutrophils primarily function in early immune responses by rapidly recruiting to infection sites, phagocytizing pathogens, and releasing cytotoxic mediators. Macrophages, with their longer lifespan, play a role in antigen presentation, cytokine production, and the clearance of cellular debris.",
                      "wrongAnswer_1": "Neutrophils are responsible for producing antibodies and activating T cells, while macrophages primarily function in blood vessel dilation and recruiting other immune cells. Together, they help control inflammation and promote tissue repair.",
                      "wrongAnswer_2": "Neutrophils and macrophages both produce nitric oxide and superoxide, which directly neutralize pathogens without the need for phagocytosis. They also help in angiogenesis and growth factor production to promote immune cell proliferation.",
                      "wrongAnswer_3": "Neutrophils primarily function in antigen presentation and cytokine secretion, while macrophages engulf pathogens but are unable to kill bacteria or degrade necrotic tissue. They play a minor role in host defense compared to other immune cells.",
                      "wrongAnswer_4": "Neutrophils and macrophages have distinct functions: neutrophils are responsible for producing chemokines and recruiting other leukocytes, while macrophages only participate in the adaptive immune response by presenting antigens to T cells without direct microbial killing or debris clearance."

Neutrophils inhibit bacterial killing and phagocytosis, while macrophages suppress cytokine production and antigen presentation.
