            "question": "What are the most common clinical manifestations of acute GVHD, and what organs are typically affected?",
            "goodAnswer": "Acute GVHD typically presents with fever, macular erythroderma, and diarrhea due to T cell-mediated damage in the skin, liver, and intestines.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Acute GVHD presents with fatigue, weight loss, and pancytopenia, primarily affecting the bone marrow, lymph nodes, and heart.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "It manifests as dyspnea, chest pain, and hemoptysis, with acute GVHD causing direct damage to the lungs, leading to inflammation and fibrosis.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "It usually presents with headache, blurred vision, and dizziness, as it primarily affects the central nervous system by attacking glial cells and neurons.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Acute GVHD causes generalized weakness, abdominal pain, and vomiting due to widespread damage in the stomach, pancreas, and kidneys."

            "question": "What is the fundamental basis of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and what are the primary target organs affected by this immune reaction?",
            "goodAnswer": "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) arises from mature T cells within the graft recognizing host MHC molecules, leading to an inflammatory response in the skin, liver, and intestines. It is caused by donor-derived immunocompetent cells attacking the recipient's tissues.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "GVHD is triggered by the host's immune system attacking foreign MHC molecules in the transplanted graft, primarily affecting the heart, lungs, and kidneys. It occurs when the recipient's T cells recognize and destroy antigens from the donor tissue.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Graft-versus-host disease develops when B cells within the graft differentiate into plasma cells that produce antibodies against the host's vascular endothelium, leading to widespread thrombosis and organ damage. The primary targets are the blood vessels of the transplanted organ.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "GVHD occurs due to a mismatch in minor histocompatibility antigens, causing a direct cytolysis of host cells by natural killer (NK) cells. It predominantly affects the nervous system, leading to neurological symptoms such as headache, dizziness, and weakness.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "It is a form of autoimmune disease triggered by environmental factors rather than immune cells from the donor. The affected organs are typically those with high metabolic activity, such as the brain, spinal cord, and pancreas."

            "question": "How does HLA matching reduce the risk of acute rejection in transplantation, and what is the role of minor histocompatibility antigens in this process?",
            "goodAnswer": "HLA matching reduces the chance of T cell recognition between the donor and recipient, decreasing acute rejection. Minor histocompatibility antigens can still trigger immune responses even with identical HLA types, leading to rejection in some cases.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "HLA matching ensures complete immune tolerance between donor and recipient, eliminating the need for immunosuppression in all cases. Minor histocompatibility antigens play no role in rejection, as T cells only recognize major HLA molecules.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "HLA matching increases the risk of acute rejection by presenting more targets for T cell activation. Minor histocompatibility antigens are not self-proteins but rather exogenous antigens that do not contribute to immune responses in transplantation.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "HLA matching is only effective when all HLA molecules are identical, and it completely prevents rejection. Minor histocompatibility antigens are not expressed on immune cells and therefore do not influence T cell activation or lead to rejection.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "HLA matching involves identifying compatible blood groups rather than MHC molecules. Minor histocompatibility antigens are only relevant in antibody-mediated rejection, not T cell-mediated rejection."

            "question": "Why is immunosuppression generally still required even with HLA-identical sibling donors, and what is the rationale behind this decision?",
            "goodAnswer": "Immunosuppression is required because of the potential for T cell sensitization to minor histocompatibility antigens, which can lead to chronic rejection. HLA-identical siblings still need immunosuppression to prevent this sensitization.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Immunosuppression is needed because HLA-identical siblings often have different blood types, increasing the risk of hyperacute rejection from preformed antibodies. It is essential to ensure ABO compatibility before proceeding with transplantation.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Even with HLA-identical siblings, immunosuppression is required to prevent autoimmune disease in the recipient. HLA matching alone does not guarantee immune tolerance, so routine immunosuppression is mandatory to avoid complications.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "HLA-identical siblings still need immunosuppression because the donor bone marrow contains mature T cells that can recognize and attack the recipient's tissues, leading to severe graft-versus-host disease. This necessitates routine immunosuppression to prevent such immune reactions.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Immunosuppression is required due to the high likelihood of bacterial contamination during bone marrow harvesting and processing, making it essential to suppress the immune system to prevent infections rather than just rejection."

            "question": "What makes bone marrow transplantation particularly susceptible to both host-versus-graft and graft-versus-host immune reactions?",
            "goodAnswer": "Unlike solid organ transplantation, bone marrow transplantation involves the engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells, which differentiate into mature immune cells that can mount immune responses against the host tissues. This leads to both GVH and HVG reactions.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Bone marrow transplantation does not involve immune cells, so it is not susceptible to GVH or HVG reactions. Instead, it only requires immunosuppression to prevent rejection of marrow-derived cells by the host immune system.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "The immunosuppressive drugs used in bone marrow transplantation completely eliminate both GVH and HVG reactions by suppressing all immune activity in the body, making it safe for any donor-recipient combination.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Bone marrow transplantation only induces GVH disease, not HVG, because the implanted bone marrow cells are incapable of recognizing and attacking host tissues. This is due to the lack of T cell receptors on hematopoietic stem cells.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "The occurrence of both GVH and HVG reactions in bone marrow transplantation is independent of the donor's immune status, as the implanted marrow is always fully compatible with the recipient's immune system."

          {
            "question": "Why is it essential to select HLA-matched donors for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and how does this impact the risk of GVHD?",
            "goodAnswer": "HLA-matched donors reduce the likelihood of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) because the immune cells in the graft are less likely to recognize the recipient's tissues as foreign. HLA-mismatched donors pose a higher risk of GVHD since their immune cells can react with the recipient's MHC molecules, leading to an inflammatory response against the host.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "HLA-matched donors are only required for vascularized organ transplants, not hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, as the immune response in bone marrow transplantation is minimal. HLA-mismatched donors can safely donate as long as they are ABO blood group compatible.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "HLA matching is irrelevant in stem cell transplantation because the procedure itself fully suppresses the host immune system, preventing any rejection. GVHD only occurs with bacterial infections, not immune reactions against the donor graft.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Donors should always be HLA-mismatched to induce a graft-versus-tumor effect, which helps eliminate residual leukemia cells while reducing the risk of bacterial infections by boosting the recipient's immune system. HLA-matched donors increase the chances of acute rejection and make immunosuppression ineffective.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "HLA matching is crucial to prevent antibody-mediated hyperacute rejection, which occurs within hours of transplantation. In hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, HLA compatibility has no bearing on T cell-mediated rejection, as only B cells are involved in bone marrow transplantation."

          {
            "question": "Why is immunosuppression generally still required even with HLA-identical sibling donors, though the risk of rejection is lower compared to other donors?",
            "goodAnswer": "Immunosuppression is required because minor histocompatibility antigens can still induce a T cell-mediated immune response, leading to rejection.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "HLA-identical siblings have different blood types, requiring immunosuppression to prevent antibody-mediated hyperacute rejection.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Immunosuppression is needed because HLA genes are only 95% similar between siblings, making them completely HLA-matched.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Even HLA-identical siblings will have different levels of cytokines, requiring immunosuppression to regulate immune function.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "HLA-identical siblings are at higher risk of developing opportunistic infections, necessitating routine immunosuppression after transplantation."

            "question": "What are the primary targets of T cell-mediated graft rejection, and how do they influence immune recognition in transplantation?",
            "goodAnswer": "Graft rejection is primarily mediated by T cells targeting HLA molecules, which display peptides from the donor. HLA-A and HLA-B molecules present antigens to CD8+ T cells, while HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP present antigens to CD4+ T cells. This interaction between T cells and HLA molecules determines immune recognition in transplantation.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "T cell-mediated graft rejection targets only minor histocompatibility antigens, which are self-proteins loaded into HLA peptide grooves. HLA molecules play no role in this process, as T cells recognize these antigens directly without HLA involvement.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Graft rejection is entirely antibody-mediated, with antibodies produced by B cells targeting HLA molecules. T cells are not involved in this process, as HLA molecules only present antigens to B cells, not T cells. This antibody-dependent recognition occurs within hours of transplantation.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "HLA molecules are not critical for immune recognition in transplantation. Instead, natural killer (NK) cells recognize allogeneic MHC molecules, leading to graft rejection. HLA molecules simply serve as structural components with no direct role in T cell activation or antigen presentation.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "T cells only recognize alloantigens presented by macrophages and dendritic cells, making HLA molecules irrelevant in this process. HLA molecules function solely as markers of self and do not participate in T cell activation. This direct interaction between T cells and alloantigens leads to graft rejection."

            "question": "How does the toxicity of the conditioning regimen in bone marrow transplantation affect the outcome of the procedure?",
            "goodAnswer": "It can damage the bone marrow, increasing the risk of infection and complications.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Toxicity from the conditioning regimen does not affect bone marrow function and only targets immune cells.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "A toxic conditioning regimen makes the patient immune to infection and improves graft survival.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "It stimulates T cell activation, which prevents rejection and promotes immune tolerance.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Toxic conditioning regimens are designed to enhance immune function and reduce the need for immunosuppression."

            "goodAnswer": "Chronic GVHD is characterized by hypergammaglobulinemia with elevated levels of IgG and IgM",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Acute GVHD presents within the first 100 days, while chronic GVHD develops after day 100",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "T lymphocytes in the donor marrow initiate immune responses in graft versus host disease (GVHD)",

            "question": "Why is it necessary to perform HLA typing, PCR amplification and sequencing of MHC genes, and mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) in histocompatibility testing?",
            "goodAnswer": "HLA typing identifies the specific alleles of HLA antigens, PCR amplification and sequencing provide detailed information about the specific HLA genes, and MLR assesses T cell reactivity against donor antigens.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "HLA typing determines antibody production, PCR amplification identifies allogeneic differences, and MLR measures cytokine levels to detect immune suppression.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "HLA typing evaluates immune cell differentiation, amplification identifies genetic mutations, and MLR assesses B cell proliferation in response to foreign antigens.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "HLA typing measures thymus activity, PCR sequencing detects autoimmune reactions, and MLR determines the stability of immunosuppressive drugs over time.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "HLA typing identifies the size of the thymus, amplification measures T cell proliferation, and MLR assesses the function of neutrophils in recognizing pathogens."

Unlike chronic GVHD, which develops after day 100 and resembles autoimmune diseases, acute GVHD is characterized by direct immune cell-mediated cytotoxicity.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Acute GVHD targets the lungs, kidneys, and central nervous system, while chronic GVHD affects the musculoskeletal system, causing widespread pain and stiffness. It develops within the first 30 days and is immune to conventional immunosuppressive therapies.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Acute GVHD primarily affects the heart and blood vessels, leading to chest pain, dizziness, and irregular heartbeat. Chronic GVHD, on the other hand, targets the liver and spleen, causing fatigue, weight loss, and recurrent infections. It typically occurs within the first 60 days and is diagnosed by measuring cytokine levels in the blood.",

            "question": "How does corticosteroid therapy act in immunosuppression, and what are its potential side effects?",
            "goodAnswer": "Corticosteroids inhibit antigen-driven differentiation of T cells and other immune cells by altering gene expression, leading to apoptosis of activated T cells. They suppress inflammatory cells and inhibit leukocyte emigration. However, prolonged use can cause fluid retention, weight gain, and bone mineral loss.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Corticosteroids act by directly killing all dividing cells, including T and B cells, without affecting other cell types. They are used to eliminate antigen-specific clones and prevent immune responses but cause widespread tissue damage in the process.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Corticosteroids only reduce inflammation by inhibiting the synthesis of cytokines such as IL-2 and TNF-alpha, with no effect on T cell differentiation or leukocyte migration. They do not alter gene expression or induce apoptosis of immune cells.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "While corticosteroids suppress inflammatory cells and inhibit leukocyte emigration, they do so by blocking the production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, rather than acting on T cell differentiation or gene expression.",

            "question": "What are the key characteristics of minor histocompatibility antigens in transplant rejection, and how do they impact immune responses?",
            "goodAnswer": "Minor histocompatibility antigens are self-proteins presented in the HLA peptide groove; they induce immune responses when there is a genetic difference between the donor and recipient, leading to T cell activation against foreign HLA molecules. This can occur even when HLA antigens are identical.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Minor histocompatibility antigens are alloantibodies produced by the host against the donor's blood group antigens; they cause hyperacute rejection by directly attacking vascular endothelium, leading to widespread thrombosis and graft loss. This occurs only when there is a mismatch in ABO blood groups between the donor and recipient.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Minor histocompatibility antigens are T cells that recognize only the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of the recipient; they do not react with donor HLA molecules and therefore play no role in transplant rejection. Instead, they remain dormant within the host and do not contribute to immune responses against the graft.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Minor histocompatibility antigens are responsible for activating B cells against non-HLA antigens on the surface of graft cells; this leads to the production of antibodies that cause chronic rejection over time. HLA matching alone is sufficient to prevent acute rejection, as only T cells are involved in the initial immune response.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Minor histocompatibility antigens consist of alloantigens presented by macrophages; they directly induce natural killer (NK) cell activation, leading to rapid lysis of the transplanted organ. This process happens within hours of transplantation and cannot be prevented by immunosuppressive therapy."

            "question": "Why is it necessary to perform immunosuppressive therapy in all transplant pairs except identical twins, and what makes this therapy lifelong in most cases?",
            "goodAnswer": "Immunosuppression is necessary because allogeneic individuals have different HLA antigens, leading to T cell activation against foreign HLA molecules. It is lifelong because HLA antigens cannot be completely matched, and even minor histocompatibility antigens can cause immune responses over time.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Immunosuppression is only needed when HLA antigens are completely mismatched, as long as the donor and recipient are related. It is lifelong because HLA molecules are constantly changing, requiring ongoing therapy to maintain tolerance.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Allogeneic individuals have the same HLA antigens, so immunosuppression is not required. However, since genetic backgrounds are never identical, minor histocompatibility antigens always lead to T cell activation, making lifelong therapy necessary in all cases.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Immunosuppression is needed because HLA antigens are expressed differently in everyone. It is lifelong because HLA matching is impossible in unrelated individuals, and T cells will always recognize foreign antigens over time, requiring continuous therapy.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "While identical twins have the same HLA antigens, they still need immunosuppression because their immune systems are completely mismatched.

            "goodAnswer": "Combining drugs allows for lower individual doses, reducing side effects while maintaining efficacy. Drugs with different mechanisms of action are chosen to target various immune pathways and prevent resistance. This approach also helps manage toxicity and tailor treatment to individual patients.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Drug combinations are used to increase the overall immunosuppressive effect without considering side effects, as the goal is to completely suppress the immune system. Drugs are randomly selected as long as they act on T cells, and toxicity is assessed after therapy initiation.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Combining immunosuppressants eliminates the need for HLA matching, as the cocktail induces generalized immune suppression. All patients receive the same drug combination, and side effects are managed by increasing corticosteroid doses.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "The rationale is to simplify treatment by using only one highly effective drug instead of multiple agents. Side effects are considered negligible when using a single drug, and treatment plans remain standardized for all transplant recipients.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Immunosuppressive drug combinations are chosen only for economic reasons, as they reduce the overall cost of therapy by minimizing the need for different medications. All drugs are equally effective in suppressing immune responses, and side effects are similar across different combinations."

            "goodAnswer": "NSAIDs reduce inflammation by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which are mediators of immune cell activation and vascular permeability. They do not directly kill immune cells like anti-metabolic drugs and do not act by altering gene expression like corticosteroids.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "NSAIDs directly kill all dividing cells, including T cells and B cells, by inhibiting nucleotide synthesis or alkylating DNA, which eliminates antigen-specific clones and prevents immune responses.",

            "question": "Why is it necessary to perform immunosuppressive therapy in all transplant pairs except identical twins, and what makes this therapy lifelong in most cases?",
            "goodAnswer": "Immunosuppressive therapy is needed in all transplant pairs except identical twins because HLA antigens rarely match perfectly between individuals, leading to T cell activation against foreign HLA molecules. It is lifelong because of the constant threat of rejection from the recipient's immune system against the donor graft.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Immunosuppressive therapy is only necessary when there is a significant mismatch in HLA antigens between the donor and the recipient, and it can be discontinued once the recipient's immune system has stabilized.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "It is used to prevent hyperacute rejection, which occurs when antibodies against A and B blood group antigens are formed in individuals with blood group O. Since HLA identical twins have the same genetic makeup, they do not require immunosuppression.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Immunosuppression is essential in all cases because allogeneic bone marrow engraftment induces vigorous immune responses that cannot be controlled by the body's natural mechanisms. Even in identical twins, there is a risk of developing autoimmune diseases, necessitating lifelong therapy.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "It depends on the type of organ transplanted and the overall immune status of the recipient. For example, skin grafts do not require systemic immunosuppression, and individuals with severe immunodeficiency can tolerate allografts without treatment. In most cases, however, immunosuppression is needed to prevent rejection, but it can be discontinued once the graft has fully integrated into the recipient's body."

            "wrongAnswer_3": "NSAIDs work by directly killing immune cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils, to reduce inflammation in the graft.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "NSAIDs inhibit mast cell degranulation, preventing the release of histamine and other pro-inflammatory mediators, which controls allergic reactions rather than immune suppression."

            "question": "Which of the following is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used in immunosuppressive therapy after transplantation?",
            "goodAnswer": "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are not used routinely in immunosuppressive therapy. NSAIDs are used to reduce inflammation by blocking the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, act by suppressing T cell activation and cytokine production.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Cyclosporine and tacrolimus inhibit immune signaling pathways, reducing T cell activation and cytokine release.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil prevent immune cell proliferation by interfering with DNA synthesis.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Sirolimus blocks interleukin-2 (IL-2) production, thereby suppressing T cell activation and immune responses."

            "question": "How do corticosteroids function in the immunosuppressive regimen after transplantation?",
            "goodAnswer": "Corticosteroids inhibit antigen-driven differentiation of T cells and other immune cells, reducing immune activation in the post-transplant period.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Corticosteroids act by directly killing all immune cells, including T cells, B cells, and macrophages, to prevent rejection.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "They stimulate antibody production against donor HLA antigens, leading to faster graft acceptance.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Corticosteroids enhance antigen presentation by dendritic cells, resulting in increased T cell activation and a stronger immune response.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Corticosteroids only work by suppressing B cell differentiation, while leaving T cell function intact."

            "question": "Why is it necessary to use immunosuppressive drugs in most cases of organ transplantation?",
            "goodAnswer": "Immunosuppressive therapy is necessary to prevent both acute and chronic rejection of the transplanted organ.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Immunosuppressive drugs are used to stimulate the immune system and enhance graft survival.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "It is only necessary for patients who have undergone bone marrow transplantation, not solid organ transplantation.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "It is used to treat autoimmune diseases but not to prevent organ rejection.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "It is designed to completely eliminate allogeneic immune responses without any side effects."
