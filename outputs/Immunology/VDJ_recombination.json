            "goodAnswer": "Allelic exclusion ensures that each B cell expresses only one heavy chain and one light chain by halting recombination after a successful rearrangement. It does not require functional heavy and light chains to turn off the recombination machinery, and it does not involve the deletion of unrearranged alleles.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Allelic exclusion ensures that each B cell expresses only one heavy chain and one light chain, meaning it does not express both paternal and maternal alleles. This is achieved by turning off the recombination machinery after a successful rearrangement and deleting unrearranged alleles.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Allelic exclusion is the process of selecting the allele that will be rearranged first, either the maternal or paternal chromosome. It occurs before heavy chain DJ rearrangement and is designed to promote diversity by allowing multiple functional antibodies to be expressed on a single B cell.",

It requires only one functional chain (either heavy or light) to turn off recombination machinery, and it involves adding non-templated nucleotides at the junctions between gene segments.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "It guarantees the expression of both the paternal and maternal alleles of the immunoglobulin genes. This is accomplished by continuously activating the recombination machinery until all alleles are successfully rearranged, and it involves adding templated nucleotides at the junctions between gene segments."

It signals the arrest of further D to J and V to DJ rearrangements. It induces the proliferation of the lymphoblast. It is expressed only in pre-B cells and is downregulated upon successful light chain rearrangement.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "The pre-CR is composed of a fully functional heavy and light chain, and it signals for immediate isotype switching to IgG. It induces the apoptosis of lymphoblasts to eliminate cells with unproductive rearrangements. It is expressed in all stages of B cell development, including pro-B cells and mature B cells. It is upregulated upon successful light chain rearrangement.",

            "goodAnswer": "A majority of VDJ recombination events are non-productive because of random joining of gene segments. This leads to frame-shift mutations or the introduction of stop codons. Lymphocytes undergoing non-productive rearrangements fail to express functional receptors and undergo apoptosis.",

            "goodAnswer": "Isotype switching occurs in secondary lymphoid organs after activation. It involves the direct switching of the heavy chain constant region gene by a process called class switch recombination (CSR). This switching is induced by cytokines, and the IgM-positive B cell can differentiate into IgG-, IgA-, or IgE-producing plasma cells.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "The heavy chain constant region gene undergoes random mutations during isotype switching. This mutation-driven switching occurs in the bone marrow before B cell activation. It allows IgM-positive B cells to differentiate into various isotypes independently of cytokine signals.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Isotype switching involves the deletion of all downstream constant region genes. This results in a permanent loss of the ability to produce certain antibody types. For example, switching from IgM to IgG leads to the inability to produce IgA or IgE.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "The constant region genes are switched by a process called signal joint formation, which occurs in the thymus. This switching is regulated by T cell activation, and the IgM-positive B cell can only differentiate into IgG-producing cells.",

Similarly, failure to successfully rearrange the light chain will result in the cell attempting to rearrange the lambda loci. Only if both succeed does it become an immature B cell that can express IgM on its surface.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "It is not mandatory for a pre-B cell to successfully complete both heavy and light chain VDJ recombination. If the heavy chain rearrangement fails, the cell will automatically attempt light chain recombination without undergoing apoptosis. Similarly, failing to successfully rearrange the light chain will cause the B cell to undergo isotype switching instead of attempting lambda locus rearrangement. Only if both heavy and light chain rearrangements fail will the cell die.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "A pre-B cell must successfully complete both heavy and light chain VDJ recombination. Successful heavy chain recombination leads to the immediate expression of both IgM and IgD on the cell surface, while successful light chain recombination allows for further heavy chain rearrangement. If the heavy chain rearrangement fails, the cell will undergo isotype switching. Similarly, failure to successfully rearrange the light chain will cause the cell to automatically pass into the T cell lineage.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "It is not essential for a pre-B cell to complete both heavy and light chain VDJ recombination. If the heavy chain rearrangement fails, the cell will automatically attempt kappa light chain rearrangement before lambda. Likewise, failing to successfully rearrange the light chain will cause the B cell to undergo clonal expansion instead of attempting further VDJ recombination. Only if both succeed does it become an immature B cell.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Successful heavy chain recombination leads to the expression of functional IgD, which then triggers the light chain rearrangement process. If the heavy chain rearrangement fails, the cell will differentiate into a plasma cell. Similarly, failure to successfully rearrange the light chain will result in the cell undergoing cell cycle arrest. Only if both succeed does it become an immature B cell that can express IgM on its surface."

            "question": "What are the essential steps involved in the process of isotype switching in B cells?",
            "goodAnswer": "B cells initially express IgM and IgD through differential RNA splicing. Once activated, they undergo isotype switching, which involves changing the constant region of the heavy chain while maintaining the same variable region. This process is mediated by RNA splicing rather than DNA alteration, making it reversible.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Isotype switching occurs when T cells are activated, allowing them to switch between different subtypes of T cell receptors (TCR) and acquire new effector functions. This process involves changing the constant region of the TCR, which enhances the T cell's ability to recognize a wider range of antigens.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Mature B cells simultaneously express all antibody isotypes (IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE) on their cell surface. When activated, they undergo isotype switching, which involves randomly selecting a new heavy chain constant region from the available options. This process ensures that the B cell can produce any isotype immediately without further differentiation.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Isotype switching is initiated by direct antigen binding to the B cell receptor (BCR). This binding triggers a signal transduction cascade that leads to the deletion of unwanted heavy chain constant regions from the genome. As a result, the B cell can only produce a single isotype, which is determined by the antigen encountered.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Before activation, all B cells express only IgM on their surface. To undergo isotype switching, they must first encounter an antigen and successfully complete VDJ recombination for both heavy and light chains. Once this occurs, they can then proceed to change the constant region of the antibody by deleting the existing mu (\u03bc) gene and inserting a new constant region from the available options."

            "question": "Which statement correctly describes the molecular basis of isotype switching in B cells?",
            "goodAnswer": "Isotype switching occurs through an RNA-mediated process. Initially, all B cells express IgM and IgD due to differential splicing of the same primary transcript. When a B cell undergoes activation, it changes its isotype by undergoing a sequential DNA rearrangement process, leading to the expression of IgG, IgA, or IgE. This results in antibodies with different effector functions while maintaining the same antigen specificity.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Isotype switching requires a T cell-independent activation of B cells, as it involves direct antigen binding to the IgM/IgD receptors, inducing a conformational change that leads to isotype switching. This process does not require cytokines or costimulatory signals from T cells.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Isotype switching is initiated by random mutations in the constant region of the heavy chain gene. These mutations lead to changes in the amino acid sequence, resulting in different effector functions. This isotype switching process is independent of T cell interactions or cytokine signaling.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Isotype switching involves a direct change in the DNA sequence of the heavy chain gene. This permanent alteration in the genetic code leads to the production of antibodies with different isotypes. Unlike RNA splicing, DNA modification makes isotype switching irreversible.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Isotype switching requires only the presence of IL-2, which directly stimulates B cells to undergo heavy chain isotype switching. Other cytokines, such as IL-4 or IFN-\u03b3, do not play a role in this process. Therefore, only the detection of IL-2 can confirm whether a B cell has undergone isotype switching."

            "wrongAnswer_1": "Isotype switching causes a change in antigen specificity by modifying the variable region of the antibody to recognize different epitopes.",
