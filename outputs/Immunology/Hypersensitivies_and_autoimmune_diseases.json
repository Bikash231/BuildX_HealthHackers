            "question": "What is the core principle behind allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in treating autoimmune diseases, and how does it work in practice?",
            "goodAnswer": "Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation replaces the patient's immune system with a healthy one. It works by first subjecting the patient to myeloablative chemotherapy and radiation to wipe out their immune system. Then, healthy bone marrow is transplanted, which engrafts and generates a new immune system that is tolerant to the transplanted tissue.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation works by directly injecting antigen into the bloodstream, which stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies that target the autoimmune disease. This induced immune response then eliminates the source of inflammation and leads to disease resolution.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "In allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, we directly transplant T cells from a donor into the recipient's bloodstream. These T cells then home to the target organ, such as the pancreas in type 1 diabetes, and suppress the autoimmune response by producing regulatory cytokines like IL-10 and TGF-\u03bb.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation involves infusing the patient with genetically modified lymphocytes that have been pre-programmed to recognize and destroy only the cells responsible for the autoimmune disease. This targeted destruction of immune cells leads to a reduction in inflammation and clinical improvement.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "In allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, we use high-dose steroids to temporarily suppress the immune system before transplanting donor bone marrow. This allows the body to accept the new marrow without rejection, and over time, the steroid dosage is gradually reduced until the immune system fully stabilizes."

            "question": "What are the principle immune mechanisms involved in Type II ( cytotoxic ) hypersensitivity reactions, and what are the potential cytotoxic consequences of such reactions?",
            "goodAnswer": "IgG antibodies bind to target cells, leading to activation of complement, opsonization, or direct cell lysis by NK cells (ADCC). This can result in hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, or tissue injury.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "IgE antibodies bind to mast cells, resulting in degranulation and release of histamine and other pro-inflammatory mediators, leading to airway obstruction, vasodilation, and smooth muscle contraction, which can cause symptoms like allergic rhinitis, asthma, and anaphylaxis.",

            "question": "What are the characteristic features of immune complexes in Type III hypersensitivity reactions, and what is their significance in causing tissue damage?",
            "goodAnswer": "Immune complexes form when antigen-antibody reactions occur in the bloodstream. These complexes can deposit in blood vessels, leading to complement activation, neutrophil adherence, and release of lysosomal enzymes, resulting in endothelial damage and thrombosis. The size and composition of the immune complexes, as well as the rate of complex formation and clearance, determine their overall effect on tissue injury.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Immune complexes consist only of IgM antibodies and do not involve other immunoglobulin classes in their formation. They primarily deposit in the lymph nodes, where they are recognized by T cells, leading to direct cell death and reduced inflammation. The severity of immune complex deposition depends solely on the concentration of antigen in the bloodstream, while antibody levels have no influence on the process.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Immune complexes are small clusters of antibodies that form in response to bacterial infections. These complexes circulate freely in the bloodstream without causing any significant tissue damage. They are rapidly cleared by macrophages, preventing them from accumulating in blood vessels. Therefore, immune complexes play no role in the pathogenesis of type III hypersensitivity.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Immune complexes are large protein aggregates that form in response to viral infections. They primarily accumulate in the liver and spleen, where they induce B cell activation and cytokine release. This leads to increased production of IgE antibodies, which then bind to mast cells. Consequently, degranulation occurs, causing airway obstruction and allergic symptoms rather than vascular damage.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Immune complexes consist of only T cells and macrophages and do not involve antibodies. They form in response to direct sunlight exposure, leading to increased cytokine production and mast cell activation. This results in skin inflammation, causing redness, swelling, and pain. The severity of the reaction depends on the duration of sunlight exposure, while immune complexes themselves have no direct role in causing tissue damage."
